Item #: SCP-199-JP
Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: Currently, SCP-1999-JP is not fully contained. At least three Foundation agents are to be present Japanese movie theatres to prevent an SCP-199-JP appearance. One agent is to s to operate undercover in the cinema staff and monitor the purchase situation/history of each ticket. The remaining two agents are to be disguised as ordinary civilians and are tasked with making sure each screening has at least two people present. Containment procedures cannot be upheld if only one Foundation agent is present. In case of emergency, usage of up to Class-B amnestics is authorized for theatre staff and the general public.
Once every 5 months, after the movie theatre is closed, one D-Class personnel is to be placed in the theatre, screening a movie and awaiting the appearance of SCP-199-JP.
D-class personnel who have been on hold should be evacuated after the appearance of SCP-199-JP; this is not the case if other personnel may be harmed. Currently, testing of SCP-199-JP has been discontinued in consideration of the danger.
The location of the movie theatre which SCP-199-JP currently appears is known only by Foundation staff assigned to SCP-199-JP of a Level 2 Security Clearance or higher.
Description: SCP-199-JP is a humanoid entity which appears in movie theatres in Japanese theatres with only one audience member present. SCP-199-JP will stay in one theatre for about half a year and will appear out of nowhere whenever the appearance criterion is met. SCP-199-JP may appear when there is only one spectator watching a movie in the theatre, although it does not necessarily appear every time this condition is met. In addition, if this criterion is not met for more than half a year, SCP-199-JP will appear in the closest theatre in its vicinity.
Although specific details about the appearance of SCP-199-JP have not been confirmed, it is generally considered to be a thin humanoid. It is also known to walk abnormally as if to protect its right foot. Audiences often do not notice the abnormal appearance of SCP-199-JP, although it is currently unknown whether this is simply due to the dark atmosphere or a memetic effect emitted by SCP-199-JP. SCP-199-JP shows a very violent tendency for humans. However, in all confirmed cases, it has never directly killed a human. SCP-199-JP appears to be aggressive and very powerful, exceeding military-trained adult men. It has not been determined how SCP-199-JP enters or leaves the movie theatre. Staff could not determine when SCP-199-JP entered the theatre. When it exited the theatre through the doors, staff outside insisted that nobody exited the theatre, despite it being captured on camera.
Test Log: 199-JP-04, -05
Note: SCP-199-JP did not appear in experiments 199-JP-01 to 03.

Experiment 199-JP-04
Supervisor: Dr. ████
Foreward: In a movie theatre reserved by the Foundation for the experiment, D-0092 is equipped with a small camera and asked to sit in the middle seat. Two agents are located at the doors and tasked with watching for any activity through the doors. D-0092 is able to communicate over a radio with Dr. ████, who is located in a temporary observation room outside the theatre.
D-0092: So, all I have to do is watch the movie?
Dr. ████: That's right. Just report it if you see something abnormal.
D-0092: Okay. But can I get these handcuffs removed?
Dr. ████: I'm sorry, but I can't allow that.
D-0092: It's just that it's a bit painful to move the camera around…
Dr. ████: I think you'll be fine.
No unusual events occur until 30 minutes after the start of the show. The camera remains facing the screen.
Suddenly, D-0092 points the camera to the stairs leading to the seat. The camera follows the unknown person walking to the rightmost seat at the back.
D-0092: Doctor?
Dr. ████: Yes, I'm here.
D-0092: Who's that?
Dr. ████: No one else is in the theatre.
D-0092: Well, are you sure about that?
Dr. ████: I think so. You may leave the camera as it is. Please continue watching the movie.
D-0092: I can't! Is he dangerous?
Dr. ████: We're conducting this experiment to find out.
Suddenly, a cry that is neither male nor female can be heard from the area where SCP-199-JP is seated.
D-0092: That's it, I'm leaving.
Dr. ████: No, no. If you leave now, you will be terminated.
D-0092: Please let me out!
Dr. ████: Hey, keep the camera pointed at him! You will be shot if you leave now!
D-0092: Shit, I'm really scared!
Dr. ████: You can either stay here or get shot outside. Besides, it's only an hour more.
The camera captures movies reflected on the screen, and from the back seat, distress noises are recorded.
Dr. ████: D-0092, turn the camera around.
The image is dark and unclear. SCP-199-JP is sitting calmly at the back seat.
D-0092: What's going on? I haven't done anything.

(20 minutes, no change)
Dr. ████: Hey, D-0092. It will be a problem if there is only a movie shown on the camera all the time.
D-0092: Oh, I'm sorry.
When D-0092 turns the camera around, SCP-199-JP appears immediately behind D-0092 without getting up. The camera falls from the hand of D-0092 and continues to record the floor in the place from then on. After that, an agent rushed toward D-0092 and found her on the seat, bleeding and unconscious. The lower jaw of D-0092 was found missing. The agents who were placed in front of the theatre insisted that they did not see anyone entering or leaving. D-0092 was brought to the Foundation's medical facility, where her injuries were cared for.

Experiment 199-JP-05
Supervisor: Dr. ████
Matters: The experiment will be held at a theatre rented out during midnight by the Foundation. Agent ██████, armed with a pistol, is deployed in the seat in the far-right at the back of the theatre. Inside the theatre, one ordinary camera and one night-vision camera are set up to transmit to headquarters and are installed in such a way that all seats are recorded. If SCP-199-JP attempts to harm Agent ██████, two additional agents, armed with rifles, will immediately enter the theatre. Agent ██████ is able to communicate over a radio with Dr. ████
Twenty minutes after the start of the show, the camera captures SCP-199-JP sitting at the leftmost seat on the back.
Dr. ████: It arrived.
Agent ████: I'm well aware of that. Can you hear the thing squealing in a funny voice?
Dr. ████: No… Anyway, be careful.
(SCP-199-JP does not move while seated quietly for about 20 minutes)
Agent ████: I'm sorry Doc, but isn't the volume a little too loud?
Dr. ████: Is that so?
Agent ████: Yeah. It's so loud that I can barely hear you. Could you tell them to lower it a bit?
The camera records SCP-199-JP getting up and walking towards Agent ██████.
Agent ████: Why did you raise the volume again?
Dr. ████: ██████, be careful! Damn, get me through to one of those two support agents. Someone lower the volume!
Suddenly the operation of the projector ceases, surrounding the inside of the room with darkness. The induction lamp does not work for some reason. Only the sound of the movie is still flowing.
Agent ████: Doctor, the picture disappeared, I can't see anything. What's going on?
Dr. ████: (Instructing nearby researchers) Go in there! Hey, you, bring the lights into the theatre!
The night vision camera shows SCP-199-JP rapidly approaching the side of Agent ██████.
Dr. ████: ██████, it's beside you!
Agent ████: Sorry Doc, I can't hear a word you're saying. Could you repeat that?
Dr. ████: ██████, it's right beside you, take out your gun!
Agent ████: Turn down the volume, I can't hear you!
The night vision camera shows the two agents who manage to fight the darkness to reach the seat behind. Agent ██████ prepares to unholster his weapon but is unaware that SCP-199-JP is right next to him. SCP-199-JP grabs Agent ██████ and drags him from the seat. The camera confirms that SCP-199-JP's fingers are embedded in both eye sockets of Agent ██████, who is resisting intensely. SCP-199-JP leaves the theatre in a way that avoids the two armed agents, dragging Agent ██████ with little difficulty. After SCP-199-JP leaves, the projector begins to operate again and the volume returns to normal. In addition, Agent ██████ is currently missing, and his body is yet to be found.




Addendum 199-JP-A: On ██/██/20██, since Dr. ████ did not show up to work and Foundation personnel were unable to make any contact, ██████ visited the house where Dr. ████ lives alone. When no response was received, ██████ began searching the area. A full-scale investigation was launched when the body of Dr. ████ could not be located. It was found that the back door of the house was unlocked, and a Blu-Ray copy of the movie "Blade Runner" was found looping endlessly on the LCD TV. Starting from ██/██/20██, Dr. ██████ has been assigned to SCP-199-JP.
