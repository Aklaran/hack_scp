Item #: SCP-ES-053
Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-ES-053 is kept contained in the special containment cell 55-09-31-31, located at the bottom of a 90-meters-deep well, which is equipped with high-powered explosives prepared to explode in case of containment breach, an event that would bury the well and the containment cell. All maintenance operations in the containment environment of SCP-ES-053 will be carried out exclusively by Class-D subjects. By order of Ethics Committee, any subject who had either established contact or communicated with SCP-ES-053 will be eliminated immediately.
Description: SCP-ES-053 is the given designation for Lisa Montseny (henceforth referred as SCP-ES-053-A) and [REDACTED], residents of the special containment cell 55-09-31-31 at Site-06.
SCP-ES-053-A is a 36 years old human female in good health condition. She has not displayed any kind of anomaly. SCP-ES-053-A has proved been willingful to cooperate with the Foundation at all times since the containment of SCP-ES-053 was established.
SCP-ES-053-█ has been labeled as a [DATA EXPUNGED] cognitohazard element.
Addendum SCP-ES-053-01: SCP-ES-053-A has confirmed that [REDACTED] excellent health state and psychomotor development. We rely that SCP-ES-053 could be examined when it reaches [REDACTED].
Addendum SCP-ES-053-02: SCP-ES-053-A has requested telematic educational-psychology support.
· Granted. - 05-2
· Withdrawn due to possible cognitive alterations on personnel involved. - Doctor █████.
· Cognitive alterations confirmed. Communication will be only allowed via double-blind mode. - Doctor █████.
Addendum SCP-ES-053-03: SCP-ES-053-A has proposed modifications in current containment conditions. Even though she has claimed several times that [REDACTED] there is not any way to confirm it; therefore, there are no guarantees that sent personnel could protect themselves. Volunteers are accepted.
· Three volunteers entered the containment cell of SCP-ES-053 on 04/04/19██ at 13:50. [REDACTED] After their return, they were attended due to [REDACTED], interrogated and eliminated. Agents in charge of the interrogation also were [REDACTED]I confirm that SCP-ES-053-A is no longer a reliable element for containment of SCP-ES-053. - Head of Research █████.

Addendum SCP-ES-053-04: CLASSIFIED

-- Addendum SCP-ES-053 - ONLY N/3B/053


To my successor's attention,
SCP-ES-053-A no longer cooperates with the Foundation, whether because she has succumbed [REDACTED] or because she is collaborating [REDACTED], and we can assume that the contamination [REDACTED] is now unstoppable. In concordance with 05-2's orders, no new incursions within the containment environment of SCP-ES-053 will be allowed.
[REDACTED] represent an infohazard capable of causing multiple cognitive alterations. Its file is sealed. All personnel related with it (including the signatory below) will be subject to mnemotherapy. The files will be altered in an appropriate way so that personnel involved do not attempt to recover this information.
The elimination of SCP-ES-053-█ still remains impossible, given the effect that this action may have on human psyche as a whole. I can only trust that mnemotheraphy is enough to avoid the spreading of SCP-ES-053-█.
And, above all, do not allow them to leave their cell.
- Reach.
