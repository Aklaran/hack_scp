A photo of SCP-025-IT taken inside its containment chamber, note the presence of SCP-025-IT-1 partially absorbed by the pouch.


Item #: SCP-025-IT
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-025-IT is contained in a standard cell of Site Vesta. In SCP-025-IT's containment cell, there are ██ stuffed animal depicting animals of various types1. Any interaction with SCP-025-IT must be carried out in groups of at least two people and no verbal or physical interaction by individuals is allowed.
Description: SCP-025-IT appears as a stuffed animal depicting a kangaroo, produced by "Caeli™" around 20██, measuring 2,██ m in height and ██ kg in weight. Despite being able to move, interact, and communicate non-verbally, SCP-025-IT is composed solely of standard padding fabric and wadding. SCP-025-IT's baby carrier appears empty; however, the anomaly, if left alone with a human being, will immobilize it and then insert it into it. A few minutes later the subject will emerge from the waist up from the baby carrier, becoming an instance of SCP-025-IT referred to as SCP-025-IT-1.
SCP-025-IT-1 gradually takes on the appearance of SCP-025-IT, but becomes more like a rag reproduction of a kangaroo puppy. Following the complete physical change of SCP-025-IT-1, it will be slowly absorbed by the carrier until it is completely eliminated. After the assimilation, no physical changes were found in the external and internal composition in SCP-025-IT.
SCP-025-IT has a friendly and sometimes childlike attitude when it interacts with several people at once, tending to hug them or invite them to play with its toys. SCP-025-IT appears to be perfectly capable of understanding human verbal and body language, yet it is unable to make any sound. From the tests carried out using alphabet tables it emerged that SCP-025-IT has a moderate knowledge of the Italian vocabulary, but is unable to compose complete sentences. SCP-025-IT, unlike when with humans, tends to be friendly with animals even when only one specimen and SCP-025-IT are left alone.
SCP-025-IT was found after numerous reports of missing children in two T███ C█████ chain stores where SCP-025-IT was displayed. Following the disappearances, records of complaints, cries and voices coming from the belly of SCP-025-IT were reported. Upon the arrival of the team sent to contain SCP-025-IT, the latter received the █ soldiers in the shop, closed for months by police for investigation. SCP-025-IT has never opposed any resistance to the team, except at the time of the withdrawal: SCP-025-IT refused to leave without bringing with it some of the remaining plushes from the store.

Subject: D-2239, 32 years old.

Procedure: D-2239 is brought to SCP-025-IT's cell which welcomes the subject and the two guards and offers them toys. The guards stay in the room for a few minutes, inviting D-2239 to play with SCP-025-IT. After ██ minutes, the guards leave the room of SCP-025-IT.

Results: After █ minutes from the exit of the guards, SCP-025-IT stops playing, lays down the toys and stares at D-2239 for about 3 minutes. Subsequently, SCP-025-IT advances towards D-2239 to then overwhelm it and immobilize it. After that, SCP-025-IT grabs D-2239 by the neck with one hand and by the legs with the other and slips it completely into its pouch. After hours, D-2239 began to emerge from the pouch, totally naked and hairless. The subject's skin resembles the fabric, visually and on a tactile level, but the features of D-2239 are still perfectly recognizable. After █ hours, the appearance of D-2239 appears to be identical to that of SCP-025-IT, the only difference is in the age shown as the appearance of D-2239 is more due to a kangaroo puppy to an adult specimen.

Conclusion: No human being, except for tests purposes, must be alone in the containment cell of SCP-025-IT.

Date: 30/01/20██

Subjects: A domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), a domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus).

Procedure: The Canis lupus familiaris specimen is brought into SCP-025-IT cell, at the end of the test the same is done with the Felis silvestris catus specimen.

Results: With both animals SCP-025-IT behaved similarly to how it behaves with toys, having fun and spending hours playing with them and demonstrating disapproval and discouragement when being divided from the two specimens.

Conclusion: Any non-aggressive animal is free to interact with SCP-025-IT, given its harmless behavior towards them, unlike with humans.
