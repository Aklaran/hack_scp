Right arm of an SCP-150-DE Prototype (Model Sindbad).


Item #.: SCP-150-DE
Object Class: Thaumiel
Special Containment Procedures: Although its existence and properties cannot be kept secret from the personnel of the Foundation, information regarding SCP-150-DE, its manufacture and the content of Protocol ATLAS are only to made available for staff with the security clearance 3/150-DE or higher.
Instances of SCP-150-DE are only to be produced on demand and only when a suitable user has been chosen already. Should the user expire before the completion of the instance or if he is no longer available for other reasons, then either a fitting replacement is to be procured as fast as within the bounds of the protocol possible or the SCP-150-DE instance to be stored a at least three (3) different locations to impede theft until a new fitting user has been found.
Users of SCP-150-DE are to be chosen from trained MTF of security personnel exclusively. Significant for this qualification are character, psychological profile, experience, bodily fitness, physique and loyalty towards the Foundation, which are all to be evaluated during the qualification. Afterwards, their bodies are to be modified for the usage and the probands to be subjected to further training, so that they may work with the sensory input from SCP-150-DE. The exact specifications to this and the process of the selection procedure are documented in Protocol ATLAS.
Users of SCP-150-DE may not get into public and have to remain in Foundation sites outside of deployment. Families of subjects, if existing, get informed of its death and receive all Foundation benefits that become due in these circumstances. Potential candidates are to be informed about these conditions, as well as the following surgeries for the usage of SCP-150-DE and the subsequent psychological changes before the selection procedure and have to agree to them in written form.
SCP-150-DE users are to be assigned to MTF DE4-𝔙 "Die Verteidiger" (i.e. "The Defenders") and are lend to other MTFs only when necessary. To this end, MTF DE4-𝔙 is to be stationed at multiple sites. MTF DE4-𝔙 itself may out only move out in extreme situations, like a containment breach of an extremely dangerous anomaly or to prevent an imminent K-class scenario. On missions SCP-150-DE instances are to be transported exclusively via trucks of the police or via helicopter and, when practicable, only to be deployed at sites where a public witnessing isn't possible. Should a discrete operation not be possible, witnesses are to be amnesticized and media depicting these objects to be censored. Alternatively, if applicable, they can be presented as advertisements for the video game Counter Shock, which is being developed and marketed by the Foundation front company Superior Console Performance.
SCP-150-DE users have to subject themselves to monthly tests to analyze their psyche. Should a user become unstable, he is to be decommissioned and to be classified as Class-E personnel, until a decision regarding further steps has been reached. Acceptable methods in this regard are psychological therapy with subsequent employment as security personnel of the respective site, incarceration or, in emergencies, termination.
Should an SCP-150-DE user expire, his remains are to be properly interred and the materials of his SCP-150-DE instance to be returned to the production cycle after thorough study.
If they are not being studied, instances of SCP-150-DE-Α1 and SCP-150-DE-Ω are to be disassembled and locked within medium value containment lockers.
If instances of SCP-150-DE-Α or SCP-150-DE-Ω are encountered outside of the Foundation, they are to be confiscated or, upon retaliation, to be neutralized using heavy kinetic energy penetrators or other suitable weapons. The information in this paragraph is to be relayed to all agents involved in combat missions, regardless of the classification of this document.
Description: SCP-150-DE describes a series of Tactical Power Armors with anomalous properties. All currently stored or used models encase their wearer completely and make him capable of greater performance than that possible for a normal human. Some technologies used were until now not completely understood by the Foundation, although a great part of them is reproducible.
Discovery: Since 1995, the Foundation conducts research to create a functional exoskeleton for combat missions, medical treatment, and logistics. The first non-anomalous models were finished in the middle of the year 2000, but there were several problems regarding their carrying capacity and their energy supply, making them unsuited for practical applications.
In 2001, the Foundation took notice of the technology of Raptor Tec. Industries and showed great interest in their Tactical Combat Armors. Those weren’t only capable to enhance the performance capability of their users and to suppress their emotions, but also possessed haptic sensors on all surfaces and could be equipped with different weapon systems, such as grenade launchers, canons or lasers. Additionally, they provided reliable protection against several environmental influences and could be linked with the neural system of their wearer, allowing support of all actions undertaken by an inbuilt AI. At this time, the Foundation didn't know that Raptor Tec. Industries worked with anomalies and was obligated by contract to not research their products. For this reason, the power armor did not get an SCP classification and wasn’t studied. Their were successfully deployed several times in controlled environments but were only used once in the field.
During Incident #028-DE/I2, the Foundation took possession of several Tactical Power Armors of the SKP, residing in a parallel universe. At the same time, their obviously anomalous properties came to light, it was also noted that R.T.I.-Armors possessed capabilities unexplainable by the Foundation, as for example the temporary prevention of the death of a fatally wounded user and the forced take over us his body by the integrated AI. Raptor Tec. Industries was subsequently ordered to surrender to the Foundation and to hand over their anomalous technologies. Following this, the company went into hiding and from then on kept acting from the underground. Its armors were classified as SCP-150-DE-A, while the captured models of the SKP gained the designation SCP-150-DE-Ω.
The replication of those technologies proved itself difficult in the beginning until computer technichans from Site-DE03 managed to download big parts of the SKP database from R-3379-DE. While the Foundation is still not capable of understanding the basic principles of most technologies, it managed to replicate them after initial difficulties.
While technologies like the required servomotors and general construction could be replicated one-to-one, problems arose in creating the required materials, amongst other things. R.T.I. and the SKP used materials with structures, which could be produced not at all, only with great effort or only with high material costs. Foundation engineers were capable of substituting these materials with normal ones in most cases, but this resulted in lowered performance and resilience. For the bigger part, they could help themselves on this matter with data collected from files of Section XXV by Research Team 25, also in cases were usage of normal materials wasn’t feasible. Section XXV too had searched for stronger, lighter and especially easy to produce materials to counteract the constant shortage of resources in the GDR, basing themselves on documents of the SKP formerly residing in this universe, amongst others.
Another problem was posed by the supply with energy. R.T.I. used a currently for replication insufficiently analyzed accumulator, while the SKP relied on a motor, whose reverse engineered Foundation prototypes don’t operate stably at this time. This obstacle could be overcome with the aid of SCP-156-DE, which delivered information on the construction and cost-effective production of glass batteries.
Since the neuronal connection of SCP-150-DE-Α or SCP-150-DE-Ω could not be replicated until now, pressure sensors on the armors inside were initially used to move the armor with the wearer. However, that resulted in unwanted oscillations.

Test Log 150-DE/087
Foreword: In this test, the third try was undertaken to get SCP-150-DE components to mimic their wearer's movements. The test subject is a D-Class personnel, whose right arm is inserted up to the shoulder in an SCP-150-DE prototype (It is a mitten with the corresponding arm) fixed to a frame to not burden the test subject with the weight. The test is being conducted by Dr. Kulzer in a standard testing chamber in Site-DE12. Medical personnel is available on call.
<Begin Log>
D-93749: A robo-arm, how awesome!
Dr. Kulzer: Actually, it's a glove.
D-93749: Will this later become an actual suit? Would be epic.
Dr. Kulzer: No comment. Nine-three, I start the energy input now.
Dr. Kulzer flips the main switch on his control panel. The prototype starts to hum quietly.
Dr. Kulzer: Everything alright so far?
D-93749: Yeah. Everything's okay. What shall I do now?
Dr. Kulzer: For now, normal movements. Please move the arm slowly upwards.
D-93749: Gotcha.
D-93749 stretches his arm upwards. During this process, the prototype accelerates constantly.
D-93749: Hoho, this is great- WOAH!
D-93749's arm stretches a little bit over the zenit and behind the subject, before suddenly moving into the other direction and comes to a stop oriented upwards in a relatively straight position.
D-93749: Doc? I think you still have to tweak this a little bit. I pushed constantly upwards the entire time.
Dr. Kulzer: Always with the same force?
D-93749: Yes.
Dr. Kulzer: Noted. Please clench your fist.
D-93749: Okay.
D-93749 clenches his right fist.
Dr. Kulzer: And now open it again.
D-93749 opens his fist again. However, the glove bends his fingers backward, beyond their initial position before suddenly clenching again, just to bend them back once more. This process repeats itself again and again with increasing frequency and amplitude.
D-93749: AH! OUCH! TURN IT OFF!
Dr. Kulzer hastily disables the power supply but his timing halts the prototype with the fingers bent far back.
D-93749: GAAAAH!
Dr. Kulzer: Ouuuuh… MEDIC!
Medical personnel rushes into the room to help D-93749. Dr. Kulzer meanwhile locks D-93749's controls, starts the power again and proceeds to move the thump and the interior space for the other four fingers with his control elements into a position that allows D-93749 to take off the prototype. Every one of these movements is commented with suppressed cries from D-93749.
Dr. Kulzer: We will have to rework that…
Closing Statements: D-93749 suffered five broken finger joints because of the oscillations of the prototype and got treated accordingly. The mentioned flaws are being removed at the time.
I think we hit a dead end with pressure sensors. The armor has a certain lag in regard to its wearer and if he tries to counteract it, these oscillations happen. My knowledge about combat is limited but I view this as unacceptable and detrimental while deployed. There is probably a reason why R.T.I. and the SKP work with neuronal connections.
- Dr. Kulzer, Robotics Department

In the end, pressure sensors were discarded. The approach of a neuronal connection by R.T.I. and the SKP proved itself to be to complex for the Foundation engineers. Instead, the technological enhancements of members of the Church of Maxwellism were studied and replicated for the use as control elements for SCP-150-DE. These elements establish a neuronal connection between human and machine, similar to SCP-150-DE-A and SCP-150-DE-Ω and enabled the exchange of information between both. Input from SCP-150-DE is directly projected into the mind of the wearer. In opposition to the original, the ports developed by the Foundation have to be surgically implanted into the user's body and connected to its central nervous system.


Agent Häusler during one of the operations preparing him for the use of SCP-150-DE.


For these implants, users have to subject themselves to several surgical procedures. The ports are located at:

Both temples
Below the shoulder between the shoulder blades
Ca. 1 cm below the thorax at the spine
Ca. 1 cm above the pelvis at the spine

After tests with Class-D personnel had been concluded, the first models of SCP-150-DE were presented. Due to the composition of their materials, the machines with a hight between 2 and 2,3 m are not as heavily armored and efficient as the originals, but about 100 kg lighter, enabling them to reach the same velocities. The first models could be operated for three hours, a duration that could be expanded widely since then. The armors can be equipped with weapons which, depending on the model, can be attached at the arms, the hip, the shoulders and/or the back. An interface helps to acquire and attack targets, to navigate, to coordinate with others and to register their status. In addition, infrared vision allows navigating in total darkness, although the models do not possess haptic sensors. For deployment in areas hostile to life, all SCP-150-DE instances seal themselves hermetically, additionally, every unit carries a supply of oxygen that lasts for ca. 20 minutes and in some models up to one hour. If it isn't used, a ventilation system supplies the user with air and cools him down if necessary. With the exception of the application of stimulants, SCP-150-DE possesses no functions for keeping his wearer combat-ready, including means of medical supply.
Due to the limited storage capacity of the storage media inside the armor, a less efficient AI had to be used as employed by SCP-150-DE-A or -Ω, even though research in this avenue is still being conducted. This AI is capable of identifying and neutralizing cognitohazards before they can take effect. It is, however, incapable of communicating with its wearer and watch the surroundings in his stead, forcing wearers to actively decide what they want to see on their interface. To circumvent this problem a little, all instances SCP-150-DE possess a proximity alert, warning of incoming projectiles and units. The exact technical specifications can be taken from Technology Report 150-DE/98T.
Wearers of instances of SCP-150-DE have demonstrated several remarkable feats, such as:

Breaking through 50 cm thick concrete walls via ramming
Maintaining a constant speed of 60 km/h for a duration of 90 minutes
One SCP-150-DE user eliminating and/or overpowering 11 hostile units with equipment similar to the American military standard
Lifting ca. 340 kg of weight
Repelling hacker attacks directed towards the armor through the dual system of human and machine
Continued combat readiness 72 hours (with recharging of energy reserves in regular intervals)

Several models of SCP-150-DE were developed, designed for different tasks. Document 150-DE/ARGONAUT contains a list of all models currently being produced.
To equip SCP-150-DE the armors and the helmets are opened by electrical servo motors. Then, the user has to enter SCP-150-DE, causing the device to seal itself hermetically. Attention should be paid to the user wearing special turnout gear that does not cover the ports on the body, so the machine can connect with the subject.
Probably because the controls of SCP-150-DE rely heavily on the brain of its wearer, the psyche of its users slowly transforms, because the brain tries the accommodate for the unfusual requiremends This transformation leads to an improvement of analytical thinking, environmental perception, multitasking and reaction speed but at the same time impairs emotional reactions and empathy to the point of complete suppression. Subjects also will after a while to wear SCP-150-DE as often as possible, presumably because the brain adapts to the conditions of the armor and not fully readjusts to the stimuli outside of SCP-150-DE. Because of that, candidates for which SCP-150-DE instances are to be created, are to be informed about the side-effects to rule out later disobedience as good as possible.


Process protocol regarding the psychological development of Agent Taube

Foreword: The following are excerpts from the psychological evaluations SCP-150-DE user have to subject themselves to on a monthly basis. The evaluation is being conducted by Dr. Stier.

09/04/20██

<Begin Log>
Dr. Stier: How do you feel? Now that you made took your first round in the armor?
Agent Taube: Exhausted. I might have known for what I had been prepared, but to actually experience it is something entirely different the mere training for it.
Dr. Stier: How was it for you?
Agent Taube: Honestly? It is as if you could take on the world in this thing. Highly unfamiliar, but I think one can get used to it.
Dr. Stier: Because of your surgeries you are obligated to not move in public. Thoughts on that?
Agent Taube: Well, I have a few USB-ports in my face now. How should I walk without everybody staring after me? Also, here is enough this to keep me happy. Have you seen the online video library? It's epic.
Dr. Stier: And in regard to your family? Your wife? Your son?
Agent Taube: Of course, it is regrettable, but I do it to protect them from all this stuff we deal with here. I get nightmares at the thought of Jens growing up in a world controlled by the SKP or where some sort of extremely dangerous Keter anomaly has broken free.
Dr. Stier: I see… Can we do something for you?
Agent Taube: Uh, yes, can you send me a photo from Jens and Linda from time to time? I can't see them anymore but I still want to know about their well-being.
Dr. Stier: I will see what I can do.2.
<End Log>

09/01/20██

<Begin Log>
Dr. Stier: Did you get used to your armor?
Agent Taube: Yes, slowly it gets more and easier. I didn't get fully behind the interface until now, but I am confident.
Dr. Stier: Do you feel different now?
Agent Taube: Uh, yes, more experienced. I can't describe it in another way.
Dr. Stier: You have had the armor for a month but were until now never deployed. What are your thoughts?
Agent Taube: Thank God. As long as I have that thing not entirely under control, I don't want to go on a mission with it.
Dr. Stier: How are you doing otherwise? Do you like your life here?
Agent Taube: Well, it's getting somewhat monotone to see always just the same places but hey, I was being informed about that beforehand, so this one is on me. Nice pictures you send me, by the way. Do you think I can send part of my salary to Linda?
Dr. Stier: Agent Taube, you know the protocol. For your family, you are dead.We can't provide them with money which comes seemingly from nothing. Also, they already get support, the payment of the Foundation widow's pension, amongst others.
Agent Taube: It was worth a try…
<End Log>

03/05/20██

<Begin Log>
Dr. Stier: Since your first deployment seven days have elapsed. How was it for you to see yourself in action?
Agent Taube: Quite honestly, terrifying. I mean, if it wasn't for the armor this zombie would have blown me to bits with his grenade launcher.
Dr. Stier: The anomaly killed seven people in total, three of them were civilians. Does that that make you sad?
Agent Taube: Hm, of course, it is crap, but I am honestly relieved that there weren't more. That happened before we arrived. I couldn't have done a thing.
Dr. Stier: Indeed, the report confirms this.
Agent Taube: But, doctor?
Dr. Stier: Hm?
Agent Taube: I have the feeling that it should have hit me harder… I mean, that could have been my family…
<End Log>

10/01/20██

<Begin Log>
Dr. Stier: It has been two months since your last mission. How do you feel about that?
Agent Taube: The best missions are those that don't happen in the first place. For there not being a reason for them, I mean.
Dr. Stier: You train regularly with your suit, even asked if the training hours can be increased. Did something change?
Agent Taube: Well, I somehow don't feel whole without the thing anymore. I feel somewhat weak, vulnerable.
Dr. Stier: Is that the reason why you are recently seeking less contact with your colleagues?
Agent Taube: I do?
Dr. Stier: Yes, Agent. You leave your room less and less frequent and visit the recreational facilities when they are less busy. And you talk less.
Agent Taube: Hm. I didn't realize that.
Dr. Stier: Does something at your colleagues repel you?
Agent Taube: No. I just don't lie that may people in one place.
Dr. Stier: Hm. But you do cope with your restriction to this site?
Agent Taube: Yes, even better than before.
Dr. Stier: You are not bored??
Agent Taube: No.
Dr. Stier: Your wife had her birthday yesterday. Are you depressed because you couldn't be with her?
Agent Taube: That was yesterday? Err… no. Even if I could go, she thinks I am dead, so…
<End Log>

05/02/20██

<Begin Log>
Dr. Stier: Given the award you were given a week before, what are your thoughts to that?
Agent Taube: It is a proof for what I have done.
Dr. Stier: This was your twelfth successful mission. Are you worried because you had to move out unusually often in the last months?
Agent Taube: No. If something like this happens, I have to be there. I don't burden myself with sorrow.
Dr. Stier: I've heard you now go only seldomly among people and prefer to be for yourself for self-optimization.
Agent Taube: I just don't have the same interests like the rest of the staff. I have one of the hardest jobs here, even though I am rarely deployed. But if I fail on those rare occasions, it can have bad consequences. Therefore, I prefer not to waste my time left.
Dr. Stier: Some others in MTF DE4-𝔙 have the same opinion. Don't you think you could form a group?
Agent Taube: Really? That sounds more effective.
Dr. Stier: You do not know what your colleagues do in their free time?
Agent Taube: We do not talk much about private matters, there are more important things.
Dr. Stier: Like?
Agent Taube: Combat strategies, Kampfstrategien, improvable techniques, improvement suggestions for the armors and their weapons… Everything else doesn't motivate as much anymore. It just feels numb and unnecessary.
Dr. Stier: You know what is happening to you?
Agent Taube: Of course, I was warned of that before I was chosen for the surgery. I even had to sign that I had been warned.
Dr. Stier: And that doesn't worry you?
Agent Taube: Not anymore.
Dr. Stier: If your family would see you now as you are, how would you feel?
Agent Taube: Linda and… uh, Jens? Probably bad.
Dr. Stier: Did you just try to remember the name of your son?
<End Log>

11/04/20██

<Begin Log>
Agent Taube: An evaluation right after my deployment?
Dr. Stier: A month has passed, Agent.
Agent Taube: Ah, I already thought it was because of the victims.
Dr. Stier: I will also talk about that. This was your hardest mission to date, right?
Agent Taube: Indeed.
Dr. Stier: Did you know the area hadn't been completely evacuated?
Agent Taube: Yes.
Dr. Stier: And still, your MTF moved out?
Agent Taube: Doctor, this was about preventing the destruction of an entire village and the release of a Keter-class anomaly.
Dr. Stier: Is this reason enough for you not to watch out for hostages and collateral damage?
Agent Taube: You will see in the recordings of my suit that I indeed watched out for collateral damage. I just couldn't avoid all of it.
Dr. Stier: And the hostages?
Agent Taube: If everybody would have been evacuated on time this wouldn't have happened. But be honest with me. The life of two children and their mother or that of a thousand people. What would you choose?
Dr. Stier: I would not shoot the enemy through his hostages. As far as we know, you could have, with a few seconds of changing positions-
Agent Taube: You weren't there, doctor. Every second counted because we didn't had the info you have now in the aftermath. What I did was the most efficient way.
Dr. Stier: So you do not regret what you did?
Agent Taube: If you think of the overall result, no.
Dr. Stier: Do you have nightmares because of it?
Agent Taube: No. Actually, recently I can't remember anything I dream anymore.
Dr. Stier: Apropos remember, you forgot to receive the newest photos of your Linda and Jens.

Agent Taube: Who?
<End Log>






I had five victims of SCP-150-DE in evaluation for a while now and I am using the word victim deliberately. Those armors take the humanities of their wearers. They become more like robots, drilled to fulfill their task as fast and effective as possible. At this point, they are no more than the machines they wear. I urgently suggest to do something against that, to decrease the load those armors burden their wearers with. Otherwise, we also can right away view the Verteidigers not just as dead on paper.
- Dr. Stier, Psychology Department

Usually, the psychological change proceeds without incident, but in rare cases the subject develops split personalities, catatonia ore paranoia, presumed to be a defensive reaction of the own psyche against the change. Five such cases are known to date of which three became violent. Especially Incident 150-DE/017Z, which occurred on a mission, resulted in 13 causalities, among them seven Foundation employees.

We gain increased complaints from the Psychology Departments of some sites because of the condition of the SCP-150-DE users. I have to agree in the regard that we indeed put together a bunch of psychopaths and they are one of the strongest MTF we have. They are now loyal but what if more than one goes postal or a rebellion is planned?
- O4-2


Our technology is just not enough to enable the same form of controls like R.T.I. and the SKP use them, although we are working on that. And even if they are psychopaths, they are, as you mentioned correctly, one of our strongest MTFs and according to calculations still not capable to go toe to toe with SCP-150-DE-A und -Ω and prevail. And that are surely not all threats that the creators of those power armors can throw at us. We need more of them. I will request the Mother Foundation to lend us a few Hominid Replicators, so we can circumvent this lengthy selection process. Also, I view the use of evidence enforcing memes or, if everything fails, SCP-2140 for adequate to prevent an uprising. I am aware I am proposing here to brainwash or even to change the past of some of our most loyal employees but this will not even make it in the top 100 list of things that keep me awake at night. We do not do that for us but for the protection of the world. And for that, we need as much firepower as possible
-O4-12

1. A is this case stands for the Greek letter Alpha.
2. The request was later approved by the Ethics Committee. However, it was at the same time decided that in case of one or both family members expiring, Agent Taube would be receiving fakes to let him believe his family is still well, to prevent psychological instability and disobedience
