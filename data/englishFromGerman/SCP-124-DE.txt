Item #: SCP-124-DE


SCP-124-DE-1


Object Class Safe
Secure Containment Procedures: SCP-124-DE-1 is stored inside of a hatbox alongside SCP-124-DE-2. Said Hatbox is to be contained under a shatter-proof, metal-grid reinforced glass display case found inside of Sector-C1 (Sector for anomalous objects), Site-DE38. SCP-124-DE-1 and SCP-124-DE-2 are to be stored separately inside of steel cassettes in Sector-C1 (Sector for anomalous objects) in Site-DE38. Said cassettes are to be secured in two separate containment cabinets. The cassettes are provided with a biometric scanner set up only for the research personnel responsible for the objects. Additionally, a GPS transmitter has been attached to SCP-124-DE-1 and SCP-124-DE-2.
Since Incident Geist-2/4, every experiment including D-Class personnel must be carried out with said personnel carrying explosive collars. By default, SCP-124-DE-1 and SCP-124-DE-2 should be marked with water-soluble paint to identify the position of the test personnel, even when the SCP is active. In the event that one or more copies of SCP-124-DE are stolen, the containment protocol "Geisterjagd" ("Ghost hunt") is to be initiated.

• Containment Protocol "Geisterjagd“ 

· Close

Protocol "Geisterjagd" was developed in collaboration with MTF Eta-10 ("See No Evil").
The sector and all surrounding premises are sealed off and the headlights are switched off regularly. Additionally, the sprinkler system is to be turned on. The sprinkler system in Sector-C1 is to have a special mode, which adds luminescent, water-soluble colour tablets to the water. The reaction force is to be equipped with standard protection and night-vision equipment, but in addition, two members each of the reaction forces are to carry a wiring harness, with which they can tie a net between them. In teams of four (4) people are to scour the dark corridors, while the nets are as tense as possible. So far, all four (4) attempts have been able to be thwarted by moving SCP-124-DE out of Site-DE38.



After each test, SCP-124-DE is to be cleaned in an exclusive washing machine. The machine is located in a separate room equipped with an ID-card scanner. A cupboard with detergents and other washing utensils approved for SCP-124-DE is located next to said washing machine. SCP-124-DE is to be washed at 30°C, running the "fine" setting inside of the washing machine, using washing silk and an organic product by the brand "Sonett"1 used by the health food store. Subsequently, SCP-124-DE is to be dried in a tumble dryer on a drying rack located in the same room. A Foundation employee of level 2 or higher has to supervise said drying. If necessary, SCP-124-DE may be washed by hand with a soap based on organic matter.
Addendum from 20.06.2000: Since Incident 124-01-A, MTF DE38-ℜ (Rena "Seher") is to look for copies of SCP-124-DE and secure them. Founding employees must try to pollute and shoot at SCP-124-DE when encountering a hostile user. According to the current state of knowledge, SCP-124-DE will not be neutralized because of this, but this can overwhelm the user. If employees are unable to secure the new instance, the instance is to be destroyed2. In an emergency, the person in possession of the SCP may be injured and subsequently questioned. In the event that another copy of SCP-124-DE-1 appears, it will be recorded as SCP-124-DE-1-#. Clothing consisting of SCP-124-DE-A and not associated with SCP-124-DE-1 will be hereinafter referred to as SCP-124-DE-2-#.
Description: SCP-124-DE-1 designates an object similar to a hooded coat, whereas SCP-124-DE-2 designates an object looking more like a 19th century billowy hat. A label with the inscription "Prototype T1. Magistra Wunder" can be found inside of SCP-124-DE-1. The etiquette of SCP-124-DE-2 identifies it as a product of the company:" Ms Mirablis, Tapferes Schneiderlein GmbH3".
Both SCP-124-DE-1 and SCP-124-DE-2 consist of a previously unknown substance, here in the document referred to as SCP-124-DE-A, which externally resembles silk. Despite its dark colour, the fabric shimmers in the colour spectrum from red to purple. It is not clear if SCP-124-DE-A itself has anything to do with the anomalous abilities, but it is considered likely that the patterns incorporated into the fabric play an important role.
The anomalous effect is activated only when SCP-124-DE-1 or SCP-124-DE-2 are worn, meaning that they have been properly put on by a living being. Due to the anomalous effect, the wearer immediately becomes invisible alongside the clothes they wear at the moment. The same applies to objects that are fastened in pockets or on the body or on clothing4. It has been visually impossible to directly identify where the person is located. Experiments with imaging techniques, in this case, thermal imaging cameras and sonars, gave the following results:

Although thermal imaging cameras were able to recognize the area in which the carrier was located, only a "cloud" with a diameter of 4 m could be seen on the image, which barely stood out from the background.
While using sonar, there was a difficulty in evaluating the data, which is indicated by the fact that the position was only displayed with a delay.

Therefore, these methods are not applicable to field use. SCP-124-DE-1 and -2 make the wearer invisible but not physically disappear. By this fact, the presence of the "covered" can be recognized when they get wet or moves objects. The same applies if carriers and/or SCP-124-DE are contaminated in the active state. Interestingly, dirt becomes invisible to about 1 g/cm2 when it comes to SCP-124-DE in the "visible" state. If this value is exceeded, the dirt remains visible if it is not rejected by the SCP itself.
It also appears that the SCP-124-DE has the problem of becoming invisible5, in which it is supported by an antimemetic effect that acts on the observer. The observer thereby loses interest in the area occupied by SCP-124-DE's wearer. In addition, Dr. Faust has a theory that SCP-124-DE garments are additionally protected from damage such as tearing, cutting or scuffing by the sheath which produces the secondary effect. For further details, see Dr. Faust's Note to Experiment-124-DE/5 to see. SCP-124-DE attempts to explore, inter alia, the interplay of primary and secondary properties, or to copy it to eventually make it usable for field deployment, are supported. Currently, this is only compounded by the fact that no way has yet been found to extract samples from SCP-124-DE and the reaction of specimens to violence, see Testlog 124-DE/1.
Discovery: SCP-124-DE-1 came into the possession of the Foundation when agents Wiesel and Fuchs discovered the anomalous object at auction in a pawn shop. Agents Wiesel and Fuchs were alerted by the advertisement a week before to the event, with "fantastische und magische Relikte aus vergangenen Zeiten6". In the process, Agent Fuchs discovered SCP-124-DE-1 in a showcase with an envelope. She then asked the owner of the pawnshop for it was designated as the "Original Wizard's Cloak". She stated that around 1989, a young woman with a black curly hairstyle came with a parcel and traded it for bares. She allegedly said that she wanted to pick it up again, but since the saleswoman had been waiting for more than 5 years, she auctioned it, as she considered it a fashionable treasure. Agent Wiesel and Fuchs bought SCP-124-DE-1, after one of the buyers tempted it and activated the anomalous effect. After the Foundation was activated and treated with A-Class-Amnestic presenters, the auction proceeded without further incident.
The letter enclosed in the envelope at SCP-124-DE-1 is addressed to the prospective buyer, in case the previous owner does not pick it up. In summary, the new owner should "carefully and conscientiously" deal with the coat, because it is a "unique". Similar to the label, a "watermark" not recognizable with the naked eye was added. The seal of the "Ministerium für Staatssicherheit7" and, in Roman spelling, the number 25 was not noticeably applied to the naked eye on the letter in the style of a watermark. Furthermore, it is pointed out that no attempt should be made to fathom the "specificity" of the garment because the "key to craftsmanship" of the author is missing. If you want to contact, you should search for "Wounder8". The exact wording can be requested in the archive under Document Letter-124. The analysis of the paper, ink, and writing showed that it was on a typewriter from the specified period, which stated the owner of the pawn shop. In addition, there were six Instants-Photographs in the envelope. They showed five persons, 2 women, and 3 men. The pictures show people doing everyday things, like drinking coffee and working in a kind of laboratory. None of them can be seen on all six, two even only on two. In addition to a date, two or three sentences were written, apparently commenting on the scene. However, all the slides have in common, that down in the corner "friends from work" had written. Rechercheteam 259 is currently evaluating the photographs to identify the individuals.

Foreword: On October 8th, 1995, a call came in under the secret code for extern matters. By default, this conversation was recorded. Here is a transcript. Attempts to locate the call failed because apparently an anomalous effect was used that caused the signal's starting position to be changed every 5 seconds. During the conversation, every time the caller answered, there was a soft, short, buzzing hum, like from an old recorder.
Agent Fuchs: Good day, here Beate Weys10. Who is speaking?
Unknown Caller: Dull knocking Here … I would like to … 3 seconds of silence … I would like to ask if you bought a coat a few days ago.
Agent Fuchs: Yes, I did. May I know why you ask?
Unknown Caller: Whirring Because I was the owner. Did you read the letter?
Agent Fuchs: Yes. They ask that one should handle carefully and "conscientiously".
Unknown Caller: Whirring Is that all? No more?
Agent Fuchs: What do you mean?
Unknown Caller: Whirring Let's stop playing these games and put the cards on the table: We both know that this object, or should I say it Es Ce Pe or what you call it, not a normal cape is.
Agent Fuchs: What do… Agent Fuchs is interrupted
Unknown Caller: Whirring Psht … Don't try it. I have an acquaintance or can I say, friend… apparently call someone … May I call you my friend?
Second Unknown Person: Barely understandable Mais Oui! Of course, Mademoiselle is allowed to see me as her friend.
Unknown Caller: Whirring So: My friend from the "Collective" told me a lot about your "Stiftung"11, SCP Foundation was the name? Keep it, I can do something new if necessary. Maybe you'll get a better and more enjoyable version in your "Secured-Captured-Protected" hands.
Agent Fuchs: Why are you telling all this?
Unknown Caller: Whirring Because our paths have not crossed for the last time. To a good cooperation.
Agent Fuchs: Wait! Will you be so kind, to give us your name? Quieter said the agent I can give it a try…
Unknown Caller: Whirring Maybe that's fair… short silence … Ms "Wonder12". I'll tell you now nothing more, where else is the fun?
The unknown caller hung up.
End of Recording.
Note: The caller and prospective creator of SCP-124-DE-1 has been registered as a PoI-0124-DE. Apparently, she showed no intentions to harm the Foundation directly. The department for the monitoring of persons and groups of interest has instructed the agents to handle it.

I am happy to inform you that I have been able, with the help of the resources, you have provided, to develop a prototype of 4m2. I dare even say that the result even surpasses the effect of simple Imitation. The prototype has the property of making the wearer literally invisible. The only drawback is that I have found no solution to the new problem that the wearer sees nothing because the light is redirected. But I'm confident that I can resolve this as well. I will work overtime to deliver a satisfactory result as soon as possible

The Foundation became aware of SCP-124-DE-2 when a report of ghost appearances occurred in several cities around Lake Constance. The MTF-DE38-𝔐 (Morgana "Hexenmedium16") was sent as suspected of an anomaly similar to SCP-128 and was able to intern Sophie Maienberg, who has SCP-124-DE-2 in her possession. She said that SCP-124-DE-2 was a gift from her ex-boyfriend, who wanted to be lenient with her after he left her. After noticing the anomalous nature of the "gift," she initially sought revenge. However, she later began committing minor thefts. The ex-boyfriend, Jannik Weckenbauer, was found within 8 days and questioned about the "magical" gift. According to him, he got it from a side-street store called "Zauberbedarf". After the interview, both were given standard amnestication of the B-class. Finding the store on the basis of Jannik Weckenbauer's description and the label did not lead to a fruitful result.
Experiments

No experiments should be done with animals. Cross-testing with other SCPs may only be done if SCP-124-DE is worn by a Level 4 or higher expert.

SCPs involved in the Experiment: SCP-124-DE-1
Head Scientist: Dr. Stephan Faust
Further Researchers present: Dr. Lichtenfeldt
Test Subject: D-2510
Foreword: Since the effects of SCP-124-DE-1 were not known yet, the test was conducted in a class ER-2 Test Room. Also, D-2510 was not informed of the likely effect of SCP-124-DE-1.
[Start of Record]
D-2510 is led into the room where SCP-124-DE-1 is lying down on the floor.
D-2510: Hey! What do you want me to do, you [CENSUS]?!? Will be interrupted
Dr. Faust: I would like to draw your attention to SCP-124-DE. It is right in front of you. You're for that ready, aren't you?
D-2510: Yes, I see it and I'll tell you now: NOP! I will not approach that thing. I am certainly not here to do a fashion show!
Dr. Faust sighs into the microphone. The guards make their weapons ready. D-2510 grumpily moves up to SCP-124-DE-1./
Dr. Faust: Whispers something under his breath, barely audible. Why are they always so bad mood after amnesification? Turned to D-2510, well audible Please lift SCP-124-DE up.
D-2510 carefully lifting SCP-124-DE-1 with two Fingers. She stands for about two (2) minutes like that, still skeptical.
Dr. Faust: D-2510, please pull the coat over!
D-2510, apparently intimidated, follows the order. D-2510 wears SCP-124-DE-1, but it is not closed. Dr. Faust is for one (1) minute silent.
Dr. Faust: Close SCP-124-DE.
When D-2510 clumsily closes SCP-124-DE-1, it activates SCP-124-DE-1's anomalous effect. D-2510 seems to be disappearing.
Dr. Faust: Please describe your current condition as precisely as possible.
D-2510: Uh, …how … what? I feel normal …
Dr. Faust: What do you mean concretely?
D-2510: Look at me: I'm standing here, in the middle of a white room, …
D-2510 screams loudly, apparently in shock.
Dr. Faust: Can I have an answer to my question? They still feel no change.
D-2510: quenches No, I still feel the same
Dr. Faust: So we can't go ahead. Please answer my questions … Can you take off SCP-124-DE again?
D-2510: Here you have the Shitythingy back.
At that moment, D-2510 reappears. D-2510 seems to be trying to tear SCP-124-DE-1 out of frustration.
Dr. Faust: DAMNIT! Guardians, stop them from damaging the SCP!
The sound of at least one stun gun and the gurgle of D-2510.
[End of Recording]

Addendum: D-2510 suffered minor burns in the form of bites on both hands in addition to the stun gun wound in the abdominal and thoracic region. D-2510 was subsequently psychologically and medically evaluated to detect any side effects and after-effects of SCP-124-DE-1. SCP-124-DE-1 was washed in a location washing machine after no damage was detected. The burns were the first manifestation of the secondary protection effect.

Since the incident Geist-2/4 Dr. Lichtenfeldt no longer work with SCP-124-DE. She is under suspicion that she did not carry out an experiment with SCP-124-DE-1 carefully and that she managed to escape through her negligence D-4134-45. Thanks to the containment protocol "Geisterjagd", the SCP-124-DE instance could be backed up again and D-4134-45 terminated. It will be transferred to another research group and a procedure according to Founation Safety Ordinance Art. 9b "Duty of care when dealing with class D persons") will run against it.

SCPs involved in the experiment: SCP-124-DE-1 and SCP-023-DE
Head Scientist: Dr. Stephan Faust
Researcher involved: Dr. Ainsworth
Test Subject: Agent Peterson
Note: After some material analysis and the use of experts in chemistry, memetics and various groups of interest, one could assess the source of danger posed by SCP-124-DE. Cross tests were approved with other than "safe" classified SCPs.
Preface: A Standard Type 1 Test Chamber was provided for the following test.
[Start of Record]
Dr. Faust enters, followed by Dr. Ainsworth and Agent Peterson, the test room, carrying SCP-124-DE-1 in its transport case. Dr. Ainsworth brought two (2) copies of SCP-023-DE.
Dr. Ainsworth: Hurry, I want to get back to my office as soon as possible. Why do you have to // // be there?
Dr. Faust: Come on, do not be so dismissive. I have been working on the Anomlie for some time and for safety reasons, two researchers must be present.
Dr. Ainsworth: You know I do not like her "thirst for action".
Dr. Faust: I do not know why you do not like me. I understand myself excellently with Dr. med. Zwingli and the others from my team.
Dr. Ainsworth sigh.
Dr. Ainsworth: Basically, I do not care what they do privately. Let's do the tests quickly. Agent Peterson, please take these SCP-023-DE lenses.
Dr. Ainsworth hands over two copies of SCP-023-DE to Agent Peterson. She introduces her properly to her eyes. She winks three times.
Dr. Ainsworth: You should check if the lenses make SCP-124-DE visible. // To Dr. Faust// I leave you the precedence, in this experiment, "worthy" colleague Faust.
Dr. Faust: How nice of you.
Dr. Faust smiles kindly, which is why Dr. Ainsworth theatrically sigh. Agent Peterson answers.
Agent Peterson: I'm reluctant to interrupt, but where are the spiders they've gotten me?
Dr. Ainsworth: The black dots. Please do not say now that you are suffering from arachnophobia. That would be the most inopportune moment! They are probably caused by SCP-023-DE, so they do not do theater.
**Agent Peterson: ** Bends the face, but stays calm. Yuck… how tiny they are … No, no, go ahead.
In the meantime, Dr. Faust SCP-124-DE-1 tightened. The effect was reactivated when he closed SCP-124-DE-1.
Dr. Faust: Where am I?
** Dr. Ainsworth: ** I doubt that this test is necessary … we know that it is from Section XXV. At SCP-056-DE we did not try the lenses either.
Dr. Faust: SCP-124-DE and SCP-023-DE are classified as Safe. The only thing we can lose at the most is time. The least we can learn is that SCP-023-DE reviews the camouflage.
Agent Peterson: Wow, cool. Are really invisible … uh … I mean, you are …
Agent Peterson hesitates and scans the room. She does this for twenty (20) seconds until she blows up.
Agent Peterson: There … or rather here?
Dr. Faust: Did you guess?
Agent Peterson: Well … actually.
Dr. Faust: That was close. Dr. Ainsworth, please note that. Let's do a few more tests.
Note: The protocol skips a period of twenty (20) minutes since the exercise is repeated.
Dr. Ainsworth: Okay, I think we can stop. What do we learn from it? The SCP-023-DE can see through the camouflage of SCP-124-DE?
Dr. Faust: Almost. Did you notice that Agent Peterson was able to pinpoint my position? Agent Peterson, how did that happen?
Agent Peterson: Because … Because the black lint … the spiders, in a way … how do I say that? … ran away! I agree. They ran away from you.
Dr. Ainsworth: Then you should know exactly where he stood?
Agent Peterson: I had trouble, Dr. Faust to locate, especially if he has moved. Then the spiders were very nervous. It was like … my interest would be diverted away from the place in the air where they stood … and the only reason I could even locate them was that I could read the movements of the spiders better and better.
Dr. Faust: Very interesting.
Dr. Ainsworth: Apes Dr. Faust mockingly. Very interesting…
Dr. Faust deactivates the effect of SCP-124-DE-1 by pulling it out. On his face is a thoughtful expression.
Dr. Ainsworth: So that I'm not just a spectator: Allow me a question. Agent Peterson, if you are currently wearing SCP-023-DE: Can you find any "4" and "R" rune?
Dr. Faust: Oh, I know what you mean! Look, it was good they were there.
Dr. Ainsworth sighs and rolls her eyes. Agent Peterson looks at the entire outside and inside of SCP-124-DE. With the label she falters.
Agent Peterson: There is something next to the word Prototype T1 … Ma…gist…ra…Wun…der, Magistra Wunder? I can barely read it. But nowhere is there something about 4R.
Dr. Ainsworth: Are you sure? Please check everything again. If we are already here.
Agent Peterson repeats the procedure, this time takes her time./
Agent Peterson: No. The only new thing is that just as weakly a pattern is woven. Looks beautiful. I only noticed it when I looked at it like the writing, with squinting eyes and such.
Dr. Faust: No "fifth" piece in Dr. Ing. Klanics 4R- Puzzle. But one in another.
[end of recording]
Note from Dr. Faust: Now it is clear that SCP-124-DE is also endowed with a secondary trait in addition to its ability to hide the wearer. My theory is confirmed by the fact that anomalous sheathing or impregnation is likely to prevent SCP-124-DE and its carrier from being located directly (see the experiments with the imaging techniques). I also think that this layer is also responsible for protecting SCP-124X-DE from damage, as we can see in D-2510s bite-shaped burns at Experiment-124-DE / 1. It is probably maintained by the pattern. With my following statement, I may hang out of the window, but I would call it a "magic spell" similar to the one described in SCP-066-DE. If I'm correct, we'll have to change this SCP.

Note: SCP-124-DE-2 was declared as a variant of SCP-124-DE-1 by Experiment-124-DE / 5. It is believed that additional copies of SCP-124-DE are in the (black) market. The persons Magistra Wunder (PoI-0124-DE) and Ms Mirablis are merged as PoI-1989-DE, as there is further evidence that they are one and the same.
