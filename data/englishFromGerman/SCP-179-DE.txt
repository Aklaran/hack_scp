SCP-179-DE.


Item #: SCP-179-DE
Object Class: Keter
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-179-DE is currently uncontained and its location is unknown. If it should appear, potential witnesses are to be amnesticised and cover stories are to be spread to explain caused damage. If necessary, media reports are to be censored and to be declared a hoax.
No asset of the Foundation is to engage SCP-179-DE-1, except for means of self-defense or if the mission command’s objective is SCP-179-DE-1's termination. Should SCP-179-DE-1 be sighted, it is to be offered to enter Foundation custody voluntarily, but may not be forced in any way.
Individuals regarded as aggressors by SCP-179-DE, if possible, are to be removed from the combat area.
Description: SCP-179-DE is an animated stone statue of a female angel, as depicted in Christian mythology. SCP-179-DE is ca. 3,5 m in height and consists of a grey stone of unknown composition. Its weight is estimated to be at least 950 kg.
SCP-179-DE always carries a longsword and a heater shield, which also consist of stone. When SCP-179-DE is not engaged in battle, it carries the sword in its sheath and the shield on its back. Additionally, it is capable of flight with its wings, despite its composition, and reaches velocities up to Mach 2. Should SCP-179-DE be damaged, broken off parts will immediately integrate back into their fracture point, despite the gravitational action. This effect also occurs if SCP-179-DE is destroyed completely and extends to its weapons.
At all times, SCP-179-DE functions as some sort of bodyguard for a specific person, hereinafter designated as SCP-179-DE-1, following them everywhere, notwithstanding the reactions of peers or of SCP-179X-DE-1 themself. It was observed in some cases, however, that SCP-179-DE-1 can order SCP-179-DE to position itself at a certain location, as long as SCP-179-DE-1 remain in the vicinity. How SCP-179-DE-1 is selected is currently unknown but SCP-179-DE-1 seems to be always considered especially virtuous within their inserted environment. This definition, of course, varies with culture and environment, a fact SCP-179-DE apparently doesn't regard with its choice. SCP-179-DE will protect SCP-179-DE-1 until they die or perform an action viewed by it or SCP-179-DE-1's peers as one "great wrongdoing", after which SCP-179X-DE will leave its current SCP-179-DE-1 instance. This property was also observed in actions in which SCP-179-DE-1 had a conflict of interest with its environment, but not in all cases. Until now, no exact conditions could be deduced that cause SCP-179-DE to leave its chosen individual. After leaving its last instance, it will travel in a direct line to its new instance, who normally gets completely surprised by SCP-179-DE's sudden arrival and usually starts panicking until realizing that SCP-179-DE does not pose any threat to their life.
Should SCP-179-DE-1 be attacked, SCP-179-DE will attempt to repel the attack and to kill the attacker. On that matter, SCP-179-DE possesses a reaction time of 0.02 seconds and can even move fast enough to stop pistol projectiles in flight. It attacks aggressors using its sword until they are neutralized or, they get enough distance between themselves and SCP-179-DE-1 or if SCP-179-DE-1 dies. The distance needed varies heavily and if SCP-179-DE is not occupied otherwise it will attack again if said distance is not maintained. Barriers stop SCP-179-DE only temporary since it can penetrate even the composite armor of military vehicles with its sword or fist. Should such actions not ensure SCP-179-DE-1's safety, it will instead focus on their evacuation.
The Foundation encountered SCP-179-DE for the first time in 1944, but numerous records to the anomaly have already existed for a longer time. These documents suggest that SCP-179-DE has existed since 1490. According to recovered documentation, SCP-179-DE seems to be an anomaly created by the Group of Interest The Order of the Light.

Access Document 179-DE-1

Access granted

The following documents stem from a hidden chamber in the Stiftkirche in Stuttgart, Germany. The room seemed to have been walled of originally but was opened during the destruction of the church in WWII. The Foundation took a hold of the documents in 1954 because they could be traced back to the The Order of the Light.


Today is October 15th in the year 1489 of the Lord.
We reached the conclusion that the Twelve Emissaries do not require protection since no man could bestow evil unto them. But this does not hold true for the ones serving them.
But we know a solution. With the knowledge of the Twelve, we will be able to enjoy heavenly protection. We will call upon an angel, so he may keep us safe. But first, he needs a vessel he can occupy.
To be able to fulfill its task, stone seems to be appropriate. We will bestow it with various blessings, to ease the angel's duty.




Today is May 7th in the year 1492 of the Lord.
After several failures, it has been done, we have an angel! He has chosen the young Gunther as protégé, an unforeseen development, but apparently, this is how it is when you deal with a being that only protects those most virtuous. But with Gunther, we are sure, he will become everybody's shield.




Today is September 18h in the year 1492 of the Lord.
There was a skirmish in front of our church. Marauders, who soil our sacred halls with their presence. But after Gunther confronted them, they were slain by the angel as soon as they lifted their swords! This is unheard of from the angels! Life should be sacred to them! But as it was shown, this abnormality has its positives. Gunther will become a truly great member of the Order.




Today is the March 5th in the year 1493 of the Lord.
Our negotiations with the Medici Academy were crowned with success. The old man couldn’t do anything else but accept while the weird angel watched him from above. Gunther is a perfect match for such negotiations, even though he denies it. We need to search for more opportunities to use this particular angel.




Today is July 20th in the year 1495 of the Lord.
While being here, Gunther can't help the Order to achieve true greatness. But I got a letter from Italy. Gunther was requested to assist a far greater part of the Order so that more of those angels can be summoned. Who would I be, who would Gunther be, not to answer this call?




Today is July 23th in the year 1495 of the Lord.
Gunther is gone. We wanted to send him to Italy, to be of use for a bigger part of the Order. But he refused. He said that we see him only as a weapon to crush our enemies with. What a fool! But the angel remained at his side and betrayed us, who called him here! Together, they fled towards the East. I'm getting a bad feeling. What if what we called upon wasn't an angel…





Over the course of human history, SCP-179-DE got mentioned in numerous records, which were confiscated by the Foundation. What follows is a chronological list of all mentions and supposed locations of SCP-179-DE. No records exist for the unincluded periods.

1523: The Chinese Abnormality Institute mentions in a report, that SCP-179-DE had appeared in Chengdu, China and had chosen a five-year-old girl as SCP-179-DE-1. The Institute manages to take SCP-179-DE-1 and with it SCP-179-DE into custody by buying it from its parents. SCP-179-DE-1 apparently remains obedient towards the Institute until their death in 1551. SCP-179-DE, upon its unexpected departure, breaks through two doors, three walls and finally the roof of the facility it had been held in. It should be mentioned that SCP-179-DE had been called a Xiāo1 due to the unfamiliarity of the Chinese culture with Christian symbolism at the time.
1559: In the University of Pisa, the Confraternity of Saint George’s Knights finds the next instance of SCP-179-DE-1, Marco Bellini, a young student who studies SCP-179-DE together with several scholars. The multiple attempts to get SCP-179-DE under the control of the Confraternity due to its angelic nature fail because of the resistance of the object. Through the fights, however, the resident Tutore of the Medicean Academy of Occult Art becomes aware of SCP-179-DE-1 and offers it to join his Academy. SCP-179-DE-1 agrees and stays a member of the Academy until their death in the year 1578. SCP-179-DE destroys several anomalous objects as it departs to a new instance.
1713: The Seers of the Tsar locate another Instance of SCP-179-DE-1, the twenty-three-year-old Dimitri Borissowitsch Sacharow, in Nytwa, Russia, and employ it as a bodyguard for the ruling tsars. The Foundation possesses no knowledge of records from outside the court of the Tsar, which mention SCP-179-DE in this time. SCP-179-DE-1 dies in 1751, which causes SCP-179-DE to take off from the ground and destroy the roof of the Kremlin Palace.
1788: SCP-179-DE is sighted in Lourdes, France, and there protects the fifteen-year-old Marion Petit from an attempted robbery. A member of the Humanist Gentlemen residing in the town hears of this event and takes in SCP-179-DE-1 as an apprentice to study SCP-179-DE, allegedly to reproduce it or to even bestow its abilities upon humans. SCP-179-DE leaves SCP-179-DE-1 in the year of 1798, probably as a reaction to SCP-179-DE-1’s theft of funds from its benefactor. Nothing else is known about the fate of this instance.
1810: SCP-179-DE chooses Thomas Spielberg in Boston, United States, as SCP-179-DE-1. The American Secure Containment Initiative becomes aware of SCP-179-DE but fails over a period of two years to contain it. In 1812, SCP-179-DE-1 apparently decides to exploit the object by attempting to rob a bank, whereupon SCP-179-DE-1 is abandoned by SCP-179-DE and subsequently arrested by authorities.
1876: SCP-179-DE chooses an unknown individual in a cell of the Sarcik Cults in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, which can not leave the hideout anymore due to the attention it draws like this. Details of the life of SCP-179-DE are unknown, including the time it gets left by SCP-179-DE.
1921: Twenty-two-year old Akeno Nakamura from Ina, Japan, is chosen by SCP-179-DE as SCP-179-DE-1, causing the latter to enter in a state of panic. This was exploited by the Japanese Shūshū-In that took SCP-179-DE-1 into custody, promising it to free it from SCP-179-DE. In 1942, after being told about the ongoing war, SCP-179-DE-1 was, upon its own request and after the agreement of the head of the Shūshū-In transferred to the Imperial Japanese Army Special Medical Force to reproduce SCP-179-DE. On August 6th, 1945, after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, SCP-179-DE was observed by Japanese civilians as it tried to flee from the explosion but got engulfed in it. It is assumed that it had tried to evacuate SCP-179-DE-1.
1945: SCP-179-DE chooses the thirteen-year-old Pierre Dupont in Marseille, France, as SCP-179-DE-12. Over the next five years, its father, Hugo Dupont, member of a resident SAPPHIRE cell tries to destroy SCP-179-DE because of its anomalous nature with the aide of his colleagues, including physical abuse of SCP-179-DE-1.3 The The Order of the Light eventually becomes aware of SCP-179-DE and takes SCP-179-DE-1, without resistance from it itself or SCP-179-DE, into custody to release SCP-179-DE. This effort, however, remains unsuccessful due to SCP-179-DE's for the Order inexplicable condition. SCP-179-DE leaves SCP-179-DE-1 in the year 1960 when it pushes a guard out a window on the fifth floor while trying to escape from the The Order of the Light.
1960: Section XXV locates SCP-179-DE with the new instance of SCP-179-DE-1; the twenty-five-year-old Heiko Schröder from Erfurt, Germany. The Foundation would also become aware of this incident after SCP-179-DE had destroyed the roof of SCP-179-DE-1’s house upon arrival. Deployed agents, however, reported having found nothing out of the ordinary. According to records from Section XXV, they had in fact gotten ambushed by assets of the Stasi and subsequently had their memories altered. SCP-179-DE-1 was forced into cooperation by threatening to incarcerate SCP-179-DE-1’s family members, staying in the custody of the Stasi until 1989. SCP-179-DE leaves SCP-179-DE-1 in 1989 after the latter wrestles and strangles a Stasi agent, who had been sent to amnesticize and release SCP-179-DE-1.
1996: SCP-179-DE has been observed during several assaults of the Korean Group of Interest Beyond Entropy but until now SCP-179-DE-1 could not be identified with certainty.
2016: According to espionage reports, SCP-179-DE is currently in the custody of the Portuguese Group of Interest Order of the Tower and Valor.
