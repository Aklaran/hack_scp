Item #: SCP-CN-1210
Object Class: Keter
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-CN-1210-1 is contained within ██ Shrine, ██, Japan. The Shrine is disguised to be under repair, and tourist entrance is prohibited. MTF-い-02“Swordster Miko” will stand by within the containment region at all times. The primary member recruitment standards for MTF-い-02 include:

Female. Those whose ages are under 30 are preferred.
Having armed training and cold weapon combat training experiences.
Full hearing ability.

Those who are willing to join MTF-い-02 will be informed of the dangers and possible injuries of the project. Mobile Task Force members will host a drill of the ritual of “vairocana” every day, and practise training of operation and combat under complete darkness, and view the document of SCP-CN-1210 once after taking Class W Mnestic drug.
Contact with SCP-CN-1210-3 shall be made once every hour. Once contact with SCP-CN-1210-3 is lost, civilians within 10km range of the containment region shall be evacuated, and MTF-い-02 shall immediately carry out ritual “vairocana” to generate a new SCP-CN-1210-3. The new SCP-CN-1210-3 shall immediately become the commander of MTF-い-02 and will be in charge of the daily training of the Mobile Task Force. SCP-CN-1210-3 has the rights to revise the details on execution of ritual “vairocana” according to the situation.
Before the sunset of every day, SCP-CN-1210-3 should await orders near to SCP-CN-1210-1. SCP-CN-1210-3 is highly advised to be equipped with a cold weapon and a rapid firearm. SCP-CN-1210-3 should use her weapons to attack the SCP-CN-1210-A entities appearing within the item until all SCP-CN-1210-A entities are destroyed. Targets that have escaped should be hunt down, and human casualties due to targets' attacks should be handled according to standard human burial procedures.
Description: SCP-CN-1210-1 is a cuboid box made of birch with pearls decorations embedded on its surface. Its dimensions are about 33cm*22cm*10cm. The item is secured in the Honden1 of the containment facility (██ Shrine), and all attempts to move or destroy the item has failed. Continuous observation of structures and furnishings can cause slight fainting. Under conditions of usage of Class W Mnestic drug, large quantity of white paintings can be found throughout the facility.
SCP-CN-1210-2 is a “Ko-omote”2 mask placed inside SCP-CN-1210-1, of which the position of the eyes are replaced with two steel needles. Historical records have shown that SCP-CN-1210-2 is a ritual prop made by the Shūshū-In, used in the execution of ritual “vairocana”. “Vairocana” is a complicated ritual that contains multiple kinds of Shinto elements. The ritual requires 5 Miko performers, starts at sunset and finishes at sunrise on the day after. The Miko to execute the ritual should be chosen separately from Ise Jingū, Atsuta Jingū, Izumo Ōyashiro, Itsukushima Shrine and Nikkō Tōshō-gū3. They should stand by at the containment location for long term and receive inspection and training from Shūshū-In. After different tests, there is only one Miko for each shrine to have the chance of participating in the ritual each time.4
The ritual is comprised of the three following elements in general:

The imitation of the game “Hide and Seek”, and to follow one or more fixed complicated paths and move within the Shrine. Its purpose is to escape from SCP-CN-1210-A as much as possible so as to lower the casualties within the process of execution of the ritual.
A piece of "Dance of Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto" used to worship "Amaterasu"5. During the execution of the ritual, the Yata no Kagami6 should be put facing the East of where the Sun rises, to imitate the legend that the gods used a mirror facing Amaterasu to attract her to leave the house, and brought light back to the world. Its purpose is to obtain the ability to do harm to SCP-CN-1210-A through a ritual that contains elements of the goddess of the sun.
A ritual performer will wear the SCP-CN-1210-2 at the moment of sunrise. The ritual performer (given the label of SCP-CN-1210-3) will become completely blind due to damaged eyeballs, and her hair will become white within 3-5 days. Its purpose is to sacrifice the sight of the performer so as to gain the ability of observing and memorizing SCP-CN-1210-A.

Historical records have shown that SCP-CN-1210-2 and its respective ritual are special procedures designed by Shūshū-In members so as to contain SCP-CN-1210.
SCP-CN-1210-A is the general name given to the one or more intangible entity that appears within the internals of SCP-CN-1210-1 after sunset every day. All entities are strongly hostile and aggressive, and have the preference to penetrate and tear the bodies of the victims with their pseudopodia and pedipalps. All eyeballs of the victims are lost for unknown reasons.
Multiple attempts to imprison or control SCP-CN-1210-A were of no effect. Although the object has the behavioral tendency to avoid direct sunlight, reflected sunlight (such as moonlight) and man-made light do not possess the equivalent effect. The object seemed to not have spacial volume, therefore they are able to pass through any obstacles losslessly (such as attacks from live ammunition firearms). At the same time, SCP-CN-1210-A possess a strong antimemetic property. SCP-CN-1210-A itself, its victims and all the information related to any of the both cannot be memorized or understood; Class W Mnestic drug can suppress the effect, but all information will still be forgotten within 3 hours.
SCP-CN-1210-3 is the only entity capable of memorizing SCP-CN-1210-A for long term period and capable of dealing damage to it. Though all SCP-CN-1210-3 are blind, they can still sense all information and records related to SCP-CN-1210 visually. When a new SCP-CN-1210-3 is generated, the old SCP-CN-1210-3 (if survived) will lose her anomalous properties.

The first thing to become the Miko, is to know my sisters' death. No, I'm not talking about the obvious facts that us, the previous Miko, who had written these messages have all died.
Did you not find out? There have always been a few missing from the past ritual performers.
The execution of the ritual requires 5 Miko. They must receive daily training to become dexterous and alert enough, such that in the long night of monsters, there is always at least one that could survive and complete the ritual. And those who disappeared, they may have been the closest partners of you; maybe they have blocked the fatal attacks for you in the previous night —— but you probably did not remember them.
If you walk outside now, perhaps you can still see their bodies laying on the ground of the Shrine, with the familiar yet unfamiliar smile below the empty eye sockets, and this would be the last traces of them in this world. You can choose to remember them forever in your heart. Or, to obliviate them like this.

+ Message from Kobayashi Ayako, 1877:- Message from Kobayashi Ayako, 1877:


Sorry, Senpai, I still can't make up my mind even at this stage. There are blood and corpses everywhere in the Haiden9, and there is blood all over Senpai, blood of herself and the enemies'. I'm really afraid of the dark, I always felt if there are monsters lurking in the shadow of the night, and every night I must light up the light to scare them off. No, I'm afraid to become the Miko, I'm afraid of the endless darkness after losing the sight.
How useless I am, for there are no others suitable for it other than me.
“Senpai, what is the world like in blind?” I asked, as I could feel the time available for me to hesitate is running out. She let me lower my head and close my eyes. “What have you seen, Ayako?” I felt the dim light passing through my eyelids carefully, the sense of pressure that passed on from my eyeballs, and the feeling of blood vessels pulsating. “Total darkness,” I shook my head, pretending to not understand it. “Do not be afraid, as this is not the end of darkness,” Senpai gently stroke my cheeks, “when you close your second eyelids, you will see the light.”
Thank you, Senpai. I did it. I think I have seen the light.

+ Message from Shimizu Hotaru, 1901:- Message from Shimizu Hotaru, 1901:


I had to mention what happened to Ayako specifically. Her god-gifted luck has made her survive in death battles with monsters, but it couldn't protect her from an accidental disaster. She walked too fast and fell off the stairs……when I have found her, her chest is penetrated by the plant support, and her life was too weak to hold on any longer.
Eye infection, battles, accidental injuries, Miko have often died of all kinds of reasons. If the timeline is to be traced back to one or two hundred years ago, there are much to add to this list and become a very long one.
I have to do something for those who come after me. Therefore I have removed all the sharp objects in the Shrine, and started drawing. I have to paint the surface of every wall and every furniture full of portraits of monsters. This way Miko can feel these objects' shapes through our own unique sensitivity, and never bump into them again.
This may take me ten years, twenty years, or even longer than that. But I believe that all this is worth it.

+ Message from Wada Yuki, 1945:- Message from Wada Yuki, 1945:


I'm the only one left again. Please, someone, tell me why?
Every day I can hear airplanes soaring through the sky. Sometimes I will imagine,
how the faces within those cabins look.
Ah, Hotaru, can you hear it? I have fixed the collapsed Torii10. I drew pictures of the gods all over it, just like what you did back then……
Can you see it? I have covered your face with white cotton yarn, I have put you inside a wooden box filled with cherry blossom……can you feel it?
I am going to meet the nameless thing again, it stretched many many hands towards me, maybe it is just too lonely?
Na, my name is Yuki, Yu-ki, when I was born, it was snowing a great great snow……I am lonely, just like you, always a single person……
But someone said it is snowing again from the sky, and they said it was black snow, a swirling, never-ending great snow……
Na, why won't you take my hand? Why? Am I to be killed because I am the bad person? Yeah, Yes, surely I am the bad person……

+ Message from Tsukishima Kaori, 1949:- Message from Tsukishima Kaori, 1949:


Those people from GOC had come here with guns, flamethrowers and anti-oblivion drugs. The previous Miko was too feeble and refused to cooperate with experiments, therefore she was recalled. Those people promised to use technology from Prometheus Labs to heal her eyes, and they have kept their promise —— this had given me a slight feeling of hope of relief from this horrific evil spirit. They have high morale and elite equipment; when they load their guns with bullets, the crispy sounds are like intensive raindrops.
No, I should not praise them that much. Their bullets just passed through and enraged the monster. It tore them open, it tore them open, and then the Sun rose from the East. The remaining soldiers cursed with trembling voices, but I picked up my wooden sword, walked into the shadows, and pierced the sword into monsters' heads. And then after three hours —— only after three hours, the fear and anger have faded from their faces, replaced by confusion and oblivion. When they picked up their gun again and looked around for the monsters, I stopped them.
The Shūshū-In is finally incorporated into the Foundation, and the welfare is better than I thought. I met Yuki on the Natsu Matsuri11, and she looked cheerful playing with her new friends wearing Yukata12. She has lost a few years, or over a decade of years of memory, and seemed to not remember me. Somewhat I missed her.

+ Message from Margaret·Randall, 1975:- Message from Margaret·Randall, 1975:


I have built a small graveyard about a kilometer away from the Shrine. I've made markings on the signs, and you can find it following my markings.
There it has buried the bodies of the past Miko and the victims, with men and women, elders and kids. If you are lucky enough, you may be able to bury my corpse yourself. The bodies are rough and shrivelled, but not a single sign of decay, as even the insects have abandoned them, and the germs have forgotten them. The residents nearby have asked me why there are extra tableware and baby basket in the house, and why a never-married man has a child of his own.
The good news is that the number of bodies is not increasing anymore, because we have received more and more resources to enhance the containment procedures. The bad news is I couldn't answer their questions. For me an American, I have no idea how to be a Miko.
How strange would it be for me to answer them, that those were your forgotten relatives, and they have received God's redemption and risen into the heaven?

This is not the first time you are reading this document. Perhaps all your memories about this all have already been obliviated, but I would not forget you like that. You all are kids I watched growing up, and the training for decades have already been engraved deep in your mind, that antimemes, however strong they are, cannot deprive you of your instinct.
We have to thank the time which containment of anomalies can be carried out under carefully revised procedures and detailed protections. Benefited from long term training and the equipment of submachine guns, since I have taken up the duty till now, SCP-CN-1210 has not experienced even a single containment breach.
This is the 16013th time you are viewing this document. Do not worry, do not be afraid, because you are prepared.
