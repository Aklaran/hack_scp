Item #: SCP-CN-844
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: All known 124 SCP-CN-844 instances are to be stored in multiple leather bags, contained in standard containment lockers of Site-CN-21. Level 2 or above personnel and/or subject(s) for experiment are able to access and check. Every personnel except the subject is to wear gloves when contacting the item. All tests will be suspended because all properties of SCP-CN-844 have been completely studied. For any objection/special need please report to the project manager.
Description: SCP-CN-844 is an apple seed, rooting instantly when it is in contact with human skin, and sprouts several days after the root. In the process between sprouting and disappearing, SCP-CN-844 will cause psychological effects to the host, displaying as the host communicating with the item and considering it has given an answer. After 1~2 months, SCP-CN-844 will disappear from the host's skin. A variety of fruits will emerge out of the void aperiodically in the next year. The final appearance will contain an attachment of 2~4 SCP-CN-844 instances, which refers to experiment log 844-21 for details.
History: SCP-CN-844 was originally found in 01/09/2017 in an express package with "Recipient: ███"
on it beside a trash bin of the ██ community. The package also contains several rotten apples and a piece of note (see addendum 844-1). Foundation interposed for investigation quickly after a cleaner reported "grass growing on the hand". Two SCP-CN-844 instances later created by subject were successfully contained.
Addendum 844-1: A piece of note found with SCP-CN-844


███:
How long didn't you come back? Not coming home and I can't dial your phone.
Your mama passed away last week, she asked to send those apples before she go.
Remember to eat apple, and come back home. Papa misses you.
- Yours,
    Papa

Personnel: Dr. Cynthia
Subject: D-2396
Date: 03/27/2017
Objective: Place one SCP-CN-844 instance onto D-2396's forearm and keep observation for one year. Confirm the "SCP-CN-844 is extremely difficult to remove" and "SCP-CN-844 will absorb human nutrient" hypothesis previously proposed. After the experiment ends, try to obtain an interview with D-2396.
Log:
<03/28/2017> SCP-CN-844 starts to root under the skin.
<03/30/2017> SCP-CN-844 starts to sprout. No discomfort has been reported by D-2396.
<04/02/2017> D-2396 applies for a watering pot filled with water. (APPROVED)
<04/03/2017> D-2396's act of watering and humming lullaby to the sapling of SCP-CN-844 has been observed.
<04/10/2017> With the approval of Dr. Cynthia, personnels tried to remove SCP-CN-844 from D-2396's skin forcibly. The removal failed due to subject's strong resistance. Following this, D-2396 was in mild depression for 7 days.
<04/28/2017> D-2396's mild condition of anemia was found by the routine physical examination.
<05/27/2017> Insomia was observed on D-2396. Subject was "talking" to the SCP-CN-844 instance between 21:00 the same day and 6:00 the next day. However, the video record shows that the SCP-CN-844 instance didn't make any sounds or do any actions.
<05/28/2017> The SCP-CN-844 instance disappeared. No damage was found on D-2396's skin. Subject stated "it said it would come back". The routine physical examination shows that the anemia condition became worse.
<06/10/2017> Three oranges appeared in the experiment room containing D-2396. These fruits are non-anomalous according to examination. D-2396 applies to eat those fruits and stated "These are gifts sent to me". (APPROVED)
<06/28/2017> Routine physical examination shows that D-2396 is healthy.
<07/08/2017, 09/12/2017, 11/28/2017> Two grapes, a watermelon and ten strawberries appeared inside the experiment room on dates shown above.
<03/03/2018> Two cherry tomatoes and three SCP-CN-844 instances appeared in the experiment room. No anomalous phenomenons were found thereafter. According to the experiment process planned previously, the observation on D-2396 should be continued.
<03/05/2018> D-2396 is extremely depressed and rejected to accept lunch provided by personnel.
<03/28/2018> The routine physical examination shows that D-2396's physical age increased by 4 years.
Conclusion: The experiment confirmed two hypothesis in the objective and fully observed anomalous phenomenons existed in a year after SCP-CN-844 entity disappeared. This experiment is the most successive one among all experiments with SCP-CN-844. After the experiment ended, we proceeded an interview with D-2396. See interview log D-2396 for more information.

Interviewed: D-2396
Interviewer: Dr. Cynthia
<Begin Log>
Dr. Cynthia: Hello, D-2396.
D-2396: Hello.
Dr. Cynthia: This interview is mainly for asking some questions, therefore confirm the properties of the anomaly planted on your arm a year ago.
D-2396: Okay. You can start.
Dr. Cynthia: First question, please describe your psychological condition after SCP-CN-844 disappeared.
D-2396: I don't know psychology. It's simply feeling bad and I can't refresh myself.
Dr. Cynthia: Do you know why you're in this condition?
D-2396: Partly. It's because the one on my arm … What's its name again?
Dr. Cynthia: SCP-CN-844?
D-2396: Yes, it is it. I raised it up all along for months, and I have asked your people for watering pot to water it. But it never came back after it left last time.
Dr. Cynthia: You know 844 is absorbing your nutrient, right?
D-2396: Of coarse! How would it survive otherwise?
Dr. Cynthia: Then why did you apply for water pot and water it?
D-2396: That's for it to be healthy, you'll understand it whenever you got a kid…
Dr. Cynthia: (Interrupted) Do you know where it is now?
D-2396: No. I chatted with it for a long time at the night before it goes. It said it wanted to spread its wings. Just as expected, it disappeared the second day. Gifts were sent at first, but now … might being too busy.
Dr. Cynthia: Can you explain how do you converse?
D-2396: It's normal. I say a line, it says a line. We really talked for a long, long time …
Dr. Cynthia: (Interrupted) Can you still hear its sound now?
D-2396: No. Not after the departure.
Dr. Cynthia: One last question. What relationship do you think is between SCP-CN-844 and you?
D-2396: Relationship? This is not easy, at least not like cats and dogs. I feel like … Maybe this is too emotional, I feel like it is like my child.
Dr. Cynthia: Thank you for expressing your opinion.

Closing Statement: Following this, Dr. Cynthia applied for a monthly call to the family for the project related personnel (APPROVED, relevant personnel should be regularly given Foundation Loyalty Test, contents and addresses of the call should be strictly recorded and regularly reviewed.)
