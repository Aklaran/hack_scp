Item #: SCP-153-KO
Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: First of all, what must be carved into the top priority is that the document is not a naturally occurring abnormal object, and that the document of SCP-154-KO registered as SCP-153-KO is authentic It is to recognize that it is an abnormal object and follow the accommodation protocol below. [Subsequent Discard]
The online accommodation of SCP-153-KO was put on hold. Both the document and SCP-153-KO are treated as abnormal objects.
Description: SCP-153-KO is the document SCP-154-KO of the Foundation database. SCP-153-KO suddenly appeared on the foundation database on September 2, 2008. At that time it consisted of numbers and special characters that had no meaning, and we could not delete / modify it in any way. As a result, on September 20, the same year, it was officially recognized as an abnormal object, and the contents related to the abnormal object SCP-153-KO was described in the database SCP-153-KO (hereinafter referred to as "THAT document").
However, immediately after THAT document was created, SCP-153-KO changed its own content, mimicked THAT document and conversely claimed THAT document was an abnormal object, plus SCP-153-KO also modified its own document creation time and wrote it as a document that was written before THAT document, causing considerable confusion at the abnormal object manager in charge….
After that, THAT document was also revised to be content that describes that SCP-153-KO is a genuine abnormal object after repeated refurbishment. SCP-153-KO also corrected its own contents each time, and on the contrary stated THAT document is an abnormal object. Due to this situation, many Foundation officials who are working only on-line became impossible to distinguish between SCP-153-KO and which of the documents are genuine abnormal objects.
In order to solve the influence of SCP-153-KO, a number of measures were proposed and actually added to the special accommodation protocol. However, every time additional measures were taken, the abnormality of SCP-153-KO spread not only to document SCP-154-KO but also to the entire Foundation database1 and to other parts. Here is the content of the response SCP-153-KO indicated to SCP-153-KO, which was attempted up to now by the measure taken to compare THAT document online, and its measures.

We confirmed late Dr.████ was exposed to memetic kill agent one year ago from the periodic spiritual examination of the foundation staff at the end of 2009. Already Dr.████ was in the position of chief executive more than five times with the procedure of several accommodation protocols described above. After that, according to the questionnaire about SCP-153-KO, it was confirmed that opinion on which of the two documents is already genuine is already divided for each foundation site.

The existing accommodation protocols were discarded and in effect was instructed to consider both SCP-153-KO and THAT document as objects.
