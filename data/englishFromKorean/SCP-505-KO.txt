SCP-505-KO


Item #: SCP-505-KO
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedure: At this point in time, SCP-505-KO does not require any special containment procedures. It is in use at a cookery for D-Class subjects at Site-█.
Description: SCP-505-KO is a normal-looking randoseru (Japanese style schoolbag). Some blood has seeped into the bottom of the bag. Turning the bag upside down while closed results in the bag opening and disgorging various human body parts. DNA examination shows that the bodies are from different individuals. The body parts that emerge from the bag include heads, limbs, genitals, internal organs, etc. In a recent test, by repeating this procedure seven times, enough body parts were collected to compile an almost complete human body. The bodies from the bag had notably suffered little to no decomposition, and both female and male bodies were collected. However, the age of the body parts does not seem to go beyond 20 (this was verified via telemetric analysis).
SCP-505-KO was retrieved from a kidnapping murder scene in Japan in 20██.
Addendum: Proposal

There is a way to make good use of SCP-505-KO. Tie this up to a rotary device and keep it in constant rotation, and thus, theoretically, an infinite amount of animal protein can be acquired. This could dramatically reduce the purchasing costs for foodstuffs for D-class. ~ Containment Specialist █████████
Approved. However, █████████ must undergo psychiatric evaluation. Depending on the results, she is to be administered either Class A to C amnestics, or terminated. ~ Director of Site █.
