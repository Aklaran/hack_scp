Item #: SCP-002-PT
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: Covert operatives of the Foundation shall inspect registers, and shops for remittance records for any signs of SCP-002-PT reissues. Seized copies should be arranged as detailed in Protocol OBJ-002-PT-0. There are currently 40 polypropylene sealed copies that should be retained in the Archives 66-002 of Storage Site-66, which should be inspected daily to verify that all 40 copies in stock have not been tampered with or removed. Tests covering SCP-002-PT, SCP-002-PT-A or SCP-002-PT-B must be approved by three personnel with Clearance Level 3 or higher.
Uncontained subjects affected by SCP-002-PT-A must undergo a psychological evaluation and moved to standard humanoid containment cells at the Humanoid Containment Site-22. Psychological follow-up and treatment should be performed in accordance with Protocol 002-PT-AB-VS, and individual cases should be reassessed on a monthly basis, which should be detailed in a report submitted for evaluation by the current Lead Researcher of SCP-002. Based on such reports, subjects with improved mental health displaying cooperative behaviour should be transferred to Site-26 (officially registered as "Retiro São Carvalho da Penha"1) for permanent community stay.
Description: SCP-002-PT are editions of the Brazilian fashion and teen lifestyle magazine titled Capricious from February 4, 2014, comprised by 80 pages in offset paper colours with 20,2cm x 26,6 cm dimensions, with a cover illustrated by the face of the actress, and Brazilian model Bruna Linzmeyer. This cover features Beauty Guide: How to Improve Your Look?, Copy the Divas, 10 back-to-school relationship tests! among others.23 Despite efforts by the Foundation, none of the listed editors, reviewers, or columnists has been identified, and it is assumed that those are pseudonyms; Ms. Linzmeyer denies any involvement with the cover photo and Editor ████ states that it has no records of such publication ever being made.
Articles published in SCP-002-PT vary in gender, and content type; with themes of fashion, beauty, daily life, platonic, romantic, and sexual relationships, directed at an adolescent and adult female audience, containing abrasive, and inappropriate comments and advice that reference negative characteristics of possible readers to incite them to commit acts of self-mutilation, and even suicide.
SCP-002-PT has no recognizable anomalous properties unless the contents of its pages are read by a sentient human being who can understand Portuguese in a formal modality; subjects who read at least 40% of the content of SCP-002-PT4 are affected by a disturbing cognitive-hazard element of direct action, which induces them to conceive themselves, as well as others, as humanoid creatures with varying levels of body transfiguration (classified as SCP-002-A and -B). This condition often induces symptoms of bodily inadequacy and personal dissatisfaction, with subjects reporting having defects such as "unkempt hair/extremely porous skin/oily skin" and "a deformed face", which makes them rapidly develop various mental disorders related to their appearances56 until now. None of the individuals affected by SCP-002-PT-A have been observed physically exhibiting the reported characteristics.
SCP-002-PT also appears to have amnestic or memory-affecting properties; after exposure to SCP-002-PT-A, subjects report that they have always perceived of themselves as well as other individuals with such characteristics, although tests show that subjects have normal cognition and personal conceptions (for individuals of similar age) prior to their exposure to the object. Application of amnestics did not succeed in reverting subjects to their mental states before the exposure to SCP-002-PT, but behavioural therapies7 were successful in influencing those affected by SCP-002-PT-A to be perceived with the same characteristics present in SCP-002-PT-B, which significantly reduces mental disorders previously presented. Studies about effective treatments for complete cancellation of cognitive disorders have not been successful but are in progress.
SCP-002-PT was discovered in May 2014 after a considerable increase in suicide rate and diagnoses of psychosis and schizophrenia in adolescents from densely populated metropolitan areas, mainly ████ █████████-██ and █████ ██ ██████-██. When subjects admitted to hospitals and psychiatric wards (without previous history of diagnosed symptoms) were asked about the reason for such sudden behaviour, they said they were afflicted by a strong feeling of inadequacy, related to the presence of specific transfigurations in their bodies (now classified as SCP-002-PT-A) compared to characteristics considered normal and desirable (classified as SCP-002-PT-B). When questioned about what led to the brutal methods of self-mutilation frequently observed, some subjects mentioned reading about such in a magazine aimed at the young female audience, although they did not recall specific details. Investigations in the residence of one of the subjects8 led to the discovery of SCP-002-PT (later confirmed as the journal mentioned by the respondents and in past or present possession of other subjects affected by SCP-002-PT-A), which was suspected and subsequently confirmed to have potential cognitive risks, based on observations of its disturbing content. 40 instances of the object are stored in File 66-002 of Storage-66, intended for possible future experiments.

- Hide

SCP-002-PT-A mainly affects young humans between 10 and 17 years of age, although rare cases have been reported in individuals between the ages of 8 and 52 years.9 Symptoms of SCP-002-PT-A may manifest instantaneously or up to 72 hours after reading SCP-002-PT's contents, including personal conceptional changes with recurring characteristics10 like:

Scalp and hair follicles with texture and appearance similar to a poriferous material, wood and decaying algae;
Epidermis with texture and appearance similar to human tissue with varying levels of infection and/or putrefaction, sewage residue, semi-digested foods combined with bile and faecal material (human or rural animals);11
Atrial cartilage, nasal pyramid and lips (upper and lower) comprised of protruding and dilated tumours, ranging in size from 5.5 cm to 10.2 cm;
Body constitution and height simultaneously feeling inadequately skinny, fat (from 35 kg to 390 kg), and short, tall (about 1,4 m to 2,2 m).

These described symptoms often influence subjects to reach extremes in attempts to 'fix' their appearance by means of cosmetic application of toxic chemicals in their bodies and extreme self-mutilation, with the purpose of shaping their physical appearance in order to bring it closer to that of subjects designed as SCP-002-PT-B — which is how individuals affected by SCP-002-PT-A perceive other human beings, both personally and by artistic representations.
SCP-002-PT-B consists of characteristics fundamentally contrary to those of SCP-002-PT-A, such as:

Scalp and hair follicles with texture and appearance similar to organic materials such as silk, cotton and/or bird feathers;
Epidermis with texture and appearance similar to various solidified beverages and crystallized fruits, including but not limited to milk, coffee, chocolate, peach, vanilla and cinnamon;
Atrial cartilage, nasal pyramid and concave upper and lower lips, submerged up to 5 cm in facial bone structure;
Body constitution and a "perfect" height for a healthy teenager/adult (about 50 and 85 kg/1,65 cm to 1,85cm).

It is to be noted that subjects affected by SCP-002-PT-B do not suffer any cognitive disturbance and such changes are limited only by the designed conception of subjects affected by SCP-002-PT-A; in addition, subjects affected by SCP-002-PT-A also see other subjects affected by the same anomalous effects with the appearance of SCP-002-PT-B.

Beauty Guide: How to Improve Your Look?

By Capricious Redacting
Take care of the skin, the hair… You still have time to see and learn everything that has to be put into practice before going back to school!

Do you love makeup, producing12 yourself, and consuming everything that involves the beauty universe? So enjoy going back to school to try a new look, treat your hair and do other things to take care of your visual. Believe me: there's still time, baby, but you better run!
1. Renew thine skin
I bet after this summer you must be feeling hor-ri-ble, even more with that greasy, burnt skin, practically falling apart! Even dung must be more hydrated than you during this summer, don't you think? I bet you must be thinking now: "But Capricious, what do I need to be delicious? My pharmacy moisturizer does not work and I look like a caricature of a human being who was vomited by beasts that feed on fire and sulphur!"
Fret not, my girls! There are lots of super creative ways you can invent to actually polish this sewage compost and rotten meat that you call skin through super effective homemade moisturizers, like bee honey mixed with sugar, avocado with aloe vera extract mixed with rainwater, homemade bleach, sandpaper, graters, or better yet: All together! If you're creative you can make it all fit into one allowance.
2. Treat your hair
Anyone who has spent this suuuper hot holidays enjoying the Sun, sea or just staying at home watching the hottest shows should already be noticing the consequences of cooling their heads for so long. If you are only now realizing how much your hair is porous, dry and rotten, like someone who literally took a nuclear bomb to the face compared to those hypnotizing silk threads of the diva ███████ ███████, I bet you're itching to know what to do about it, urgently. So let's put your hand in the dough!13
Use a hair plank, Babyliss and mousse — do not waste it if you really want to shake that mane on the way back to class just in the most smooth and tame way as possible! For a hair like yours, the treatment of the current trend is the progressive brush with jabuticaba (just don't eat it!). Do you have the allowance? Get a flatiron (yes, that one from your mother) and warm up that scalp! For more effective results, try to make a mixture of ██████, ████ syrup, chlorine and ███████████ of █████: mix everything in a bucket and sink your head for about 5 minutes, it'll be MARVELOUS!
3. Make an innovative makeup
Think of a makeup that you would love to produce, but it seems impossible to look good on you thanks to this set of inflamed boils that you call 'face'. I bet you've seen, like, 5 tutorials to try and make contour like ██████ █████ and you ended looking like a clown who got caught and had her face deep into a fryer full of hot oil and charcoal, right? No shame, you can admit. Do you think there's no way to fix this face? Here's the tip (it works even when you need to cook!): There's stuff you can't reuse, and it's easier to it throw away. Take a knife, blowtorch, whatever you have available and start to cut everything that you can until your face is smooth, but you have to work hard, it's no use giving up on the first sign of difficulty (tip: a sock in the throat isolates any noise, and still distracts you from the pain!). When you notice that you are exfoliated enough, use lots of mask and eyeliner to highlight your new fantastic and super attractive mouth, plus a blush in your favourite pink shade on those cheeks, giving that colour. For detailed tips on how to take advantage of makeup trends, see page 20!
None of these tricks worked? Can not stand your shameful existence any longer? Here's the best trick to solve any nuisance you may have with your out-of-season look:
4. Finish with style
According to research from the University of ████████, California, these are the most effective means to commit suicide, but do not think these are the only ones: be creative! ;)
