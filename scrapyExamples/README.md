Here are two web scraping examples. These are from 67364. I hereby forbid you
from using anything in this directory for that class or from distributing
these resources to anyone not on our hackathon team. I have not looked at
these examples in a year, so I'm sorry if they are not helpful. Feel free to
ask questions.

1) a3 - an assigment where we had to scrape details about the top apps from
the apple web store. This likely no longer works because apple often changes
the structure of their website.
2) c1-28 - documents from a class where we were taught how to use scrapy

Notes:
- xpath helper is a helpful chrome extension when working with scrapy
- [this](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) tutorial
acutally seems pretty useful and is likely better than anything found here
- you can probably find even better tutorials with a quick google
