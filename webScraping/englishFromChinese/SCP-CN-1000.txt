THE FOLLOWING FILE REQUIRES LEVEL 5/CN-1000 CLEARANCE

I don't know how long this document can survive. Those clearance thing were all fucking made up, in order to prevent those over-cautious-level-5-personnel and lower level ones from scrolling down. If you see this, then you have to be an AIC or a reckless inquisitive person.
Fuck, I really don't know if I saw something I'm not supposed to … fuck, I don't know.
… Let's get to the point.
Yesterday midnight at about … 2355 or so. I was monitoring the Tachyon Physics Lab of Site-CN-91, and a small … incident happened. Because of the Tachyon Turbulence, we got a tiny distort at 2355. And during this I got a bunch of files that are … not seeming right. The original recipient was Site-01. The receivers at Site-01 might be anxious that they started reading files almost right after they were received … and what had been decrypted were thus synced to me.
But the source of those files do not seem to be on our timeline. The sender seemed to be … from after 300 years.
You may not realize what this meant … so I will explain. It means three problems.
First of all, we accidentally connected to some server of Site-01 for about 15 seconds. It shows that Site-01 has also built a Tachyon Lab or something else. No matter what it is, they must be dealing with time anomalies. But Site-01 always claimed that they are not equipped with any researching or containing function.
Secondly, receiving files from future may result in chains of paradoxes and unresolvable problems. However, Site-01 and O5s, think they have prepared everything for this, such as building a fucking Tachyon Physics Lab and hiding it from everyone.
If we consider Site-01 concealing its real function as special consideration of their managers, then I really don't know what to say about the following things. This bunch of file includes … fuck, I don't know how to summarize. View it yourselves.






SAP-001
SAP-069
SAP-090



Project #: SAP-001
Class: Junior-Hostile-Observe Influential-Low Threat
Target Transfer Year and Position: 1936, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
Description: SAP-001 is remodeled from a Military Assassin Drone, DFI"HvNT". It's outer shell was revamped into a khaki-colored concrete statue. SAP-001's system is highly specialized as following:

Three MaNCER neutral monitors were appended to its abdomen in order to allow it to detect visual signals from humans around it.


A GMR-2 thaumatransport device was appended to the base of its thigh. The device can achieve a complete spell definition, chant and backlash redirection within 0.2 seconds. This thaumaturgy made SAP-001 able to move 200 meters in a time period equivalent to a human blink. The only flaw was that the device may produce wastes, displaying as a combination of feces and blood.


All weapons were removed and the combat program was rewritten. When no vision were detected, SAP-001 will be transported to the nearest human and attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation.

Expected Influence: SAP-001 is to be transferred to a densely populated urban area. About 20 to 30 injuries were expected to be caused by SAP-001 before its properties were summarized correctly. The said properties were going to be spread among local areas while further injuries happen. Government forces are eventually going to get involved and block any related information. SAP-001 will be simply suppressed due to its relatively mild abnormalities. Organization(s) responsible for securing SAP-001 may try to damage or disassemble SAP-001, but apparently, they may not disrupt its defense subsystem.
Comparing to traditional myths, SAP-001's tales are going to go with more details and higher credibility. SAP-001 may become the origin of urban legends or similar subcultures.


Project #: SAP-069
Class: Junior-Assistant-Tool-No Threat


A part of SAP-069's decorative parts


Target Transfer Year and Position: 1955, New York City, New York, USA, inside an abandoned factory.
Description: SAP-069 is remodeled from a K-OFF Type Extend-Enchant Handling Device. A large amount of decorative parts were appended to the shell. The parts include, but not limited to, the following:

Screw drives, belts, pulleys, gears, springs and other clockwork


Other over eight million non-standard moving parts

The said parts were comprised mostly of tin and copper, with some wooden and cloth items. All decorative parts are to be similar to technical level at early 19th century. The core of SAP-069 will be constantly checking the completeness of decorative parts. If any of them were confirmed lost, SAP-069 will stop working.
SAP-069 has been set 4 additional incomplete work states, labeled "Rough", "Coarse", "1:1" and "Very Fine". Working in "Rough" or "Coarse" state would apply degenerate changes to the output item, while "Very Fine" state applies unnecessary properties and functions, and "1:1" state only causing the shape to change. The original state is labeled "Fine".
Expected Influence: SAP-069 will provide a massive amount of safe research opportunities on anomalies. A government institute focused on anomaly researches is expected to be found after SAP-069's discovery. Personnel in action for Ye Ming Protocol are to enter the said organization and guide their research orientation. The Masquerade Protocol to "Secure" the anomaly, "Contain" them, and "Protect" the human society from hazard is to be established at this time.


Project #: SAP-090
Class: Junior-Hostile-Biological Hazard-Medium Threat


The color bar pattern of the tertiary structure of SAP-090


Target Transfer Year and Position: 1959, ████, Soviet Union.
Description: SAP-090 is a prion. A concept lock is appended to its structure in order to allow it to ignore its complexity while duplicating itself and spreading stably inside its habitat. The host of SAP-090 will start a nerve rebuild after their brain death. After that, the host's thinking ability will be eliminated as well as the basal metabolism being restrained. Individuals infected by SAP-090 are extremely aggressive. In order to supress, a complete infected individual have to be given serious cranial trauma.
Note: Due to SAP-090's potential subcultural feature, personnel in action for Ye Ming Protocol are to be giving assist on spreading audio, video and text records related to individuals infected by SAP-090, in order to increase its influence in urban legends and in the society.
Due to its potential for mass destruction, personnel in action for Ye Ming Protocol are to release their concept locks as SAP-090 starts to show signs for eruption, in order to let it corrupt naturally.
Expected Influence: SAP-090 is expected to cause about 100-500 deaths until eventually being suppressed. The potential at militarization may make SAP-090 a great bargaining chip between governments. Foundation's international status may be raised at this time.

As a note, I'm Noah … out-posted engineer from the Headquarters, currently responsible for monitoring the Tachyon Physics Lab at Site-CN-91.
You may think it's stupid to say my name here, but when I was writing this thing onto the database, I gave up my hope to get out of this thing safely. ISD will find every line you left in the database and every fingerprint you left on your keyboard, no matter how you hid yourself.
Overall, I worked in many Sites at the Headquarters and have seen many SCPs. I saw the SAP list familiar - SAP-001 for SCP-173, SAP-090 for SCP-008, and SAP-069 for SCP-914. And note that there are two logos on the background of those documents, the Foundation one and the Coalition one.
The guards and polices of the paranormal world.
I lived through two containment breaches in Site-17. In the first one, I lost my computer. In the second one, I lost the whole squad I belonged to.
I worked with them for three years.
And now, those fucking shits told me that everything we contained for lives were fucking transferred from the future.
Tell me what I can do.


Apologies, we met a problem. A Chinese engineer edited our cover page for the cover page and complained about something … apparently he thought that CN-1000 is really a blank page. ISD is working on this. No, relax, it's only the amnestics.
We made a temporary entrance. Click here to go back to the home page.
Um, just a reminder. If Noah's note made you feel bad, remember to go to the psychologist.
