Item #: SCP-032-IT
Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-032-IT is to be held in an H32 standard humanoid cell in Site Plutone. As a temporary containment measure, the object can be held in a smaller enclosure, as it is mostly immobile; about two times a month, it is active between 10:00 pm and 2:00 am.
Level 3 personnel may access SCP-032-IT’s containment cell. Any researcher who would like to talk with SCP-032-IT is required to be fluent in either ancient Latin, Etruscan or ancient Greek; alternatively, it is possible to use an Anderson-Sumire Mk-II neural interpreter1.
An armed guard must always escort SCP-032-IT when it is transported to X-ray rooms for analysis; this is only a precaution, since SCP-032-IT is usually very cooperative, despite trying to probe those who interact with it with its appendices.
If SCP-032-IT issues requests for obtaining raw materials, these requests are to be forwarded to Dr. Bellini or, in his absence, to the Site Director. These requests are to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but are generally satisfied; in this case, the raw materials needed by SCP-032-IT are to be collected in Storehouse M-12.
Any and all personnel requiring physical contact with SCP-032-IT must wear protective rubber gloves, as to prevent cutaneous sebum from ruining SCP-032-IT’s bronze surface over time.

Note
Any offer from SCP-032-IT’s behalf to foresee future events is to be refused, with no exceptions; SCP-032-IT shows no sign of understanding how the procedure is painful and, despite not having ill intent, it will stab you before you know it.

–Dr. Bellini


Description: SCP-032-IT is a bronze statue with an opaque green color. It resembles a young human male with an athletic physique, with facial lineaments similar to those of the Greek-roman sculpting technique; it wears a short toga.
SCP-032-IT’s joints are articulated, thus allowing movement. The object shows a paraskeletric tubular structure, with universal joints that allow it a wide array of fine movements, even in the fingers, thus closely resembling human movement. SCP-032-IT is capable of autonomous movement perceived by observers as “very natural”, and is also capable of articulating human speech, making it able to sustain a meaningful conversation.
SCP-032-IT is self-conscious and, besides the aforementioned languages, is not able to learn new means of communication; it is nonetheless able to learn new concepts and definitions with the same cognitive skills as an average adult human.
Similarly to a regular bronze statue, SCP-032-IT is hollow inside; however, its insides are not empty, as they house both the aforementioned tubular structure, and a complex system of interconnected gears, the constructive technology which is compatible with that of ancient machines. It is noteworthy that the mechanical section KY94, in the anterior thoracic region, has a 98% match with the architecture of the Antikytera Mechanism. This whole apparatus allows SCP-032-IT to actuate the fine movements of its limbs; however, how these movements are achieved in the first place is yet to be understood, as its structure makes it nothing more than a complex audio-animatronic, as observable by the structural chart based on 3D X-ray analysis of the object.
If damaged, SCP-032-IT is able to revert itself to its original shape via a self-repairing process similar to biological wound regeneration; the process, however, is much slower, around 8 times. SCP-032-IT is able to achieve this regeneration even after having lost most of its initial mass, including the internal machinery; however, SCP-032-IT is no longer able to fully recover the damages on its outer surface following the prolonged stay on the oceanic floor (see Recovery Log for details).
SCP-032-IT has no need for sustenance. If the object needs repairs, though, it may require small bronze fragments (no bigger than 5 cm3) to ingest; these fragments end up in a metallic sack in the abdominal area. Using photoemission spectroscopy, it has been discovered that these fragments are slowly absorbed into the sack’s walls with a rate of approximately 0.78 g/day; the sack itself, for the duration of the phenomenon, has a temperature of 2±0.1 ºC higher than the surrounding materials.
When questioned regarding its identity, SCP-032-IT maintains its name to be Spurinna and to be a haruspex. It further states that it is “under the new sky” since the year 790 BCE, although being created at least 900 years before that. When questioned on the meaning of “new sky”, the objects state that it has noticed not to be in its “original place”, although this one is very similar; it further states that, under the new sky, it has not yet found any haruspex or augur similar to itself.

Update 21/02/2017
SCP-032-IT is noted to possess long appendages of circular section, approximately 7 mm in diameter and with pointed ends, completely retractable, articulated in 5 different points for a total length of 28 cm that, when retracted, are completely hidden from sight inside the outer surface of the object. These appendages are located above the interdigital membranes – for a total of four appendages for each hand – and on the head, respectively in the tear canals, the hearing apparatuses, and the lambdoid suture – for a total of 6 cranial appendages.
SCP-032-IT uses such appendages to penetrate the flesh of human or animal subjects and perceive the morphological properties of the internal organs, specifically the liver and sometimes the small intestine, mesentery and large intestine. This operation is carried by the appendages of one or both hands; the function of the cranial appendages is unknown, even though the structural resemblance seems to suggest a similar use. When questioned about this, SCP-032-IT explains that it is able to extend them by its will, but that they “function on their own, when necessary”.
SCP-032-IT is able to predict future events regarding a living subject, be it human or animal, that possesses a hepatic and intestinal apparatus, with the following procedure:

Once chosen a living subject, a question may be asked to SCP-032-IT regarding a future event or a present one that is unknown to the subject itself;
SCP-032-IT uses its appendages to probe the internal organ of the subject;
Once extracted the appendages, SCP-032-IT is able to answer the question.

The questions need to be asked by a third party when the subject is an animal, but can also be asked by an external entity in the case of human.
The procedure that SCP-032-IT uses in order to probe the internal organs of the subject is usually painful for the subject (if not anesthetized), but not lethal. Usually, the resulting wounds heal in about one month; additional antibiotic treatment is advised, to avoid infection.
SCP-032-IT’s predictions are generally very in-depth; for more details, see the Interviews.

► Update 10/05/2017 (Prime mover | Parasitic currents)

▼ Close

Update 10/05/2017
Subsequent analysis via CT and dosimetry revealed that the impurities present in the mechanical components of SCP-032-IT are able to move through it, causing topical imbalances of density and weight; this may bring a gear to begin spinning on its own due to gravitational pull alone. The sum of this internal weight and density shifts is the prime mover of SCP-032-IT; the rest is accomplished via normal mechanical interaction between components. Similarly, electric sensors have picked up the presence of parasitic currents throughout the structure of the object, organized in a complex network not directly linked to the motor functions of the object; it is, however, theorized that these are the basis for the cognitive capabilities of SCP-032-IT.

Recovery Log
SCP-032-IT was found in September 2015 in a naval relic, dated 43 BCE, far from the coastal city of Bagnoli by the archaeological team of ███████. The object was then brought to the Napoli Archaeological Museum, where it stayed in stock until the 10th December 2016, when it was taken into Foundation custody. All the civilians involved were inoculated with the appropriate dosage of amnestics and monitored for the standard period of time afterward.

Excerpts from the personal diary of [REDACTED], professional restorer. All sections not directly pertaining SCP-032-IT have been redacted.

21/09/2015
Today the Museum got a new, fascinating item. It is a bronze statue, probably from the 1st century before Christ; it is almost completely engulfed in marine incrustation, but from the little that emerges, it is of excellent making. It did sleep a while under the sea… but soon, everyone will be able to admire it once again.


03/11/2015
We’ve finally completed the explorative removal of the sea debris. What is inside is incredible… a Dedalus of machinery and paraphernalia! An automaton, probably of Greek making. This may have the same repercussions of the Riace Bronzes.


18/02/2016
I’m speechless, along with the new curator of the Etruscan section. This is no Greek; this automaton comes from some lost civilization that has never given us anything quite like this… and what about the gears? They’re everywhere! It’s jointed in every possible point, even in the fingers of the hands and feet! This is so much more than a Riace Bronze, ten times as much! It’s a real shame that barely half of it remains… the millennia under the sea were not kind to it.


01/04/2016
We’re out of funds. I was hoping in some kind of “April’s Fools!”, but no, it’s just the harsh reality of public spending in Arts. Wait for me, bronze young man, we’ll meet again when the golden purses flow again.


21/07/2016
Still no luck for those funds destined to the Bagnoli automaton, with that beautiful artifact rotting in the warehouse. What a shame.


30/09/2016
Finally, new funds for the restorations. I even forgot where it’s stored… no matter, I’ll find it, even at the cost of turning the whole Museum upside down!


01/10/2016
What kind of behavior is this? Such disorganization, I can’t believe it! First, the bureau gives us no money to work with, then it throws them away by assigning two different people for the same job!


02/10/2016
No one knows a thing. I really cannot understand. I want to further examine the automaton, tomorrow, but there is no other explanation.


03/10/2016
No one gave the authorization, there is no one else assigned to this project. I’m baffled. Someone must have worked on the Bagnoli automaton in the last few months. The automaton is nearly complete! And what a remarkable job at that, truly excellent. I examined the added components, but… I cannot tell where the original ends and where the new material begins!


07/10/2016
The Bagnoli automaton is now an obsession for me. The outside surface is not perfect, but the inside… it looks as if new! It’s incredible! Whoever made this must be a peerless professional… but no one knows a thing!


08/10/2016
Oh well, I’ll take full merit for this. I mean, the automaton is beautiful. I tried to manually spin a couple gears and… it moves the hand in such a natural way… I now realize that the genius of ancient must be a world still unbeknownst to us.


09/10/2016
I need to make an urgent restoration of an ushabti for the Egyptian section. It seems I’ll need to dedicate myself to this for a while.


29/11/2016
I’m either getting crazy or someone is playing a bad joke on me. Today I walked in the storeroom and the automaton was completely whole! What the hell is going on? And a work of an unseen finesse, at that…


30/11/2016
It was my second guess, after all, yes: today someone made it stand up, and I found it that way. Very funny. I’ll find you, you idiots.


04/12/2016
Actually, never mind, it was the first guess: I’m getting crazy. Today the automaton talked. It talked. IT TALKED.


05/12/2016
"Quæstio". That’s a “question”, right? What should I ask it?


06/12/2016
Ouch, that hurt. But what an incredible experience. Incredible. INCREDIBLE. I’ll be famous! So why did the automaton tell me everything will come back to normal, instead? It’s impossible!


07/12/2016
Those strange individuals going around the Museum, asking questions… they aren’t after the automaton, are they?


08/12/2016
They can’t have it… it must be at everyone’s disposal! It’s too incredible not to be!


09/12/2016
YOU’LL NEVER HAVE IT! Curses on you!


12/12/2016
I’ve been in bed for three days straight now, with the worst of headaches. Huh. I’m so confused I don’t even remember what I’ve been doing in the last year. As if it never existed in the first place. Well, the doctor said my memory will come back soon. As for these scars on my belly… I must have been doing quite the parties, uh? I even lost my old diary.


15/12/2016
Must be some kind of virus, everyone at the Museum has become even more forgetful than I am. Well, company in distress makes trouble less, I guess. Of course, if we keep going like this, working is impossible. I reckon we’ll be back to closing a couple sections for a few months, again.


17/12/2016
Actually, who was that doctor, anyway?

<begin file>
Dr. Bellini: Good morning, SCP-032-IT
SCP-032-IT: Ave to you, doctor.
Dr. Bellini: What is your name?
SCP-032-IT: My name is Spurinna.
Dr. Bellini: Fine… anyhow, I’ll call you SCP-032-IT.
SCP-032-IT: That sounds complicated, but do as your heart desires.
Dr. Bellini: What is your purpose?
SCP-032-IT: I am a haruspex.
Dr. Bellini: You predict the future?
SCP-032-IT: That is correct.
Dr. Bellini: How?
SCP-032-IT: By reading insides.
Dr. Bellini: Could you read my future?
SCP-032-IT: No doubt. Just ask me a quæstio.
Dr. Bellini: What do you need?
SCP-032-IT: I need to probe your templum.
Dr. Bellini: In order to do this you will need a sheep, I suppose.
SCP-032-IT: Even you, even here?
Dr. Bellini: “Even us” what?
SCP-032-IT: I thought of this way as gone… anyhow, no, I need your cardo and your decumano.
Dr. Bellini: Can you elaborate?
SCP-032-IT: I need your insides, doctor. It’s those that I must probe.
Dr. Bellini: My insides?
SCP-032-IT: That is correct.
Dr. Bellini: To my knowledge, haruspici used sheep insides to do that.
SCP-032-IT: That procedure is erroneous.
Dr. Bellini: Erroneous?
SCP-032-IT: Indeed. I explained to them many times, but they never listened.
Dr. Bellini: To who have you explained it?
SCP-032-IT: The people of Rasenna2, I taught them the art of the haruspicinium.
Dr. Bellini: Ah.
(Dr. Bellini scribbles on a notepad)
Dr. Bellini: Tell me more, what is the right procedure?
SCP-032-IT: If I read the insides of a sheep, I will only be able to tell the future of that sheep. It is foolish to think that such an action can be linked to the fate of someone else. That is why their haruspici never guessed right.
Dr. Bellini: And what did you do?
SCP-032-IT: I explained this to them many times. In the end, I just gave up.
Dr. Bellini: They never explained their reasoning?
SCP-032-IT: They used to say that they could not open a person up for such a thing. I do not understand. What other way is there to answer a quæstio?
(Metallic appendages come out of SCP-032-IT’s hands)
SCP-032-IT: What is your quæstio?
Dr. Bellini: Wait, wait! I don’t… I don’t want to know my future just yet!
(Dr. Bellini runs from the cell)
SCP-032-IT: Doctor…?

Dr. Bellini: Good morning, SCP-032-IT.
SCP-032-IT: Ave, doctor. Have you come back here to pose me a quæst–
Dr. Bellini: No! Ahem, no… that will be for another time.
SCP-032-IT: Please, I am able to tell you what lies ahead.
Dr. Bellini: Noted, but not for now.
SCP-032-IT: ‘Tis the human heart who demands it. It is my purpose.
Dr. Bellini: Yeah, let’s talk about your purpose.
SCP-032-IT: Do you have a quæstio?
Dr. Bellini: NO, SCP-032-IT, I do not have a quæstio.
SCP-032-IT: I see.
Dr. Bellini: Let’s talk about you. Where do you come from?
SCP-032-IT: This is my home now, but only my new home.
Dr. Bellini: You mean the Foundation?
SCP-032-IT: No, I mean this whole world.
Dr. Bellini: Please elaborate.
SCP-032-IT: When there was the light… if my calculations are correct, that would be 790 years “before”, according to your dating system.
Dr. Bellini: 790 BCE?
SCP-032-IT: Yes, 790… that word. It is strange indeed, to have a date before. Shouldn’t dates be after?
Dr. Bellini: That’s a custom of ours. When in Rome…
SCP-032-IT: What?
Dr. Bellini: Nothing. Do continue, SCP-032-IT.
SCP-032-IT: I found myself in the new home. It was very similar. Very, very similar indeed, except for the absence of haruspecis and auguris… actually, there were some, but only human ones. No one else like me.
Dr. Bellini: Where were you before?
SCP-032-IT: I told you, under a very similar sky.
Dr. Bellini: Were you born there?
SCP-032-IT: That is so.
Dr. Bellini: When?
SCP-032-IT: Over 900 years before the light.
Dr. Bellini: Who built you?
SCP-032-IT: What kind of question is that? You, doctor, who is it that built you?
Dr. Bellini: Never mind that, let’s change the subject. Have you always had your appendages?
SCP-032-IT: But of course. How could I possibly make my predictions otherwise? That is why I never could understand human haruspicis: indeed, visual assessment is a valid enough tool, but touching with one’s hand is far more effective. Even better if the inspected insides are alive.
(Dr. Bellini scribbles on a notebook)
SCP-032-IT: Do you have a quæstio, doctor?
Dr. Bellini: No…! See you tomorrow…!
(Dr. Bellini exits the cell)
SCP-032-IT: But that is my purpose…

(D-54399, equipped with an Anderson-Sumire Mk-II neural interpreter, is introduced in SCP-032-IT’s cell)
D-54399: Eh?!
SCP-032-IT: Ave. Are you a doctor?
D-54399: What the fuck are you? One of those guys playing living statues at the railroad station?
SCP-032-IT: I do not fully comprehend your statement, but I am a haruspex.
D-54399: And what the hell is that, a condom?
Dr. Bellini (via intercom): D-54399, be cooperative with SCP-032-IT.
(D-54399 spits on the ground)
D-54399: Or you’ll cut my head off, I know. Please, tin man, go ahead.
SCP-032-IT: Those words.
D-54399: Dr., this one’s gone.
Dr. Bellini (via intercom): No matter. Do as he says, D-54399.
SCP-032-IT: Do you have a quæstio for me?
D-54399: Say what?!
Dr. Bellini (via intercom): That would be "a question", D-54399.
D-54399: Hahaha, a question, you say? Fuck it, ok… where can I find the best skunk at the cheapest price?
(SCP-032-IT unfolds its appendages and stabs D-54399, who screams in pain. D-54399 tries to escape, but SCP-032-IT holds him in place with the other hand’s appendages. The probes twist and dig in D-54399’s flesh, through his muscle tissue. After 29 seconds SCP-032-IT retracts and folds its appendages. D-54399 holds his bleeding belly, runs to the door and begins pounding)
D-54399: Open up! Open up, motherfuckers! What the…! Look what he’s done! Fucking open up!
SCP-032-IT: [REDACTED], also known as “Fire Extension” in your dialect. Sells for 400, your monetary unit, for every 10, your weight unit. He can be found at the Esquilinio hill in Rome, or at the Trullo in rest days.
D-54399: Wha…? The fuck do you know?
Dr. Bellini (via intercom): That is enough, D-54399. The experiment is over.
D-54399: Whoa there, Dr., calm your horses. It hurts like hell, but the tin man got it right. Hey, tin man, I have another question.
SCP-032-IT: Do ask the quæstio!
D-54399: When will I be out of here?
(SCP-032-IT stabs D-54399 again. After 31 seconds, the appendages retreat)
SCP-032-IT: Tomorrow, at sundown, from one of the exits located towards the pars hostilis, to the west.
D-54399: Damn, it hurts… and… and how?!
Dr. Bellini (via intercom): Guard! The test is over, take D-54399 back!
(SCP-032-IT stabs once again D-54399. After 12 seconds the guard enters the room and takes D-54399 away, forcefully removing him from the probing appendages.)
SCP-032-IT: Oh…
(SCP-032-IT remains immobile, staring at nothing)
Dr. Bellini (via intercom): SCP-032-IT, are you all right?
SCP-032-IT: Was he a servus?
Dr. Bellini (via intercom): Slaves don’t exist anymore.
SCP-032-IT: Doctor… you need to know that the servus… he will be killed. He’ll die, and that is why he will be taken from here.

<inizio del file>
(D-54419, equipped with an Anderson-Sumire Mk-II neural interpreter, enters SCP-032-IT’s cell.)
SCP-032-IT: Ave. Are you a doctor… no, the same clothing as the servus… are you a favea?
D-54419: A talking statue? Is this some kind of joke?
Dr. Bellini (via intercom): D-54419, cooperate with SCP-032-IT.
D-54419: ‘Aight SCP-whatever, what do you want?
SCP-032-IT: Do you have a quæstio?
(D-54419 remains silent for some time)
D-54419: Dr., I can’t really cooperate if I can’t understand what he wants.
Dr. Bellini (via intercom): Just ask it the question you’ve been told.
D-54419: Ok then… so tell me, statue, what will happen to me in four days? Dr., should I also insert a coin or someth–
(SCP-032-IT unfolds its appendages)
D-54419: What the hell is this?!
(D-54419 escapes towards the exit. SCP-032-IT walks towards her; she runs behind the table and kicks it on SCP-032-IT, making it fall to the ground and causing a dent on its right hip. A guard enters the room and holds D-54419; SCP-032-IT gets up and stabs the subject with its appendages. Despite the violent attempts of D-54419 of breaking loose, the experiment continues as planned. 41 seconds later, SCP-032-IT retracts its appendages, remaining still for some time.)
SCP-032-IT: There is a strange animal, one I’ve never seen before, with too many legs. Favea, you need to stay clear of this animal, because… stay away from it. Although it will serve you no purpose.
D-54419: The fuck is he saying?! Let me out, you assholes!
(D-54419 is escorted out of the cell. SCP-032-IT extends its cranial appendages, which begin to probe the small dent on its side, then fold back)

Addendum
An experiment involving D-54419 and SCP-███-IT had been scheduled 4 days later; the expected outcome was D-54419’s death, and such was SCP-032-IT’s foretelling. As agreed with the Site Director, we then thought of postponing the experiment to ascertain whether SCP-032-IT could foresee the actual future or only one of the possible ones.
Four days later, SCP-███-IT escaped containment, spreading death throughout the Site. One of the victims was D-54419.

(Dr. Bellini enters the cell of SCP-032-IT with a specimen of house martin, hereafter denominated as SCP-032-IT-B)
SCP-032-IT: Ave, doctor.
Dr. Bellini: Hello, SCP-032-IT.
SCP-032-IT: What’s that that you’re holding? A small volatile, I see
Dr. Bellini: Yes, it is a house martin.
SCP-032-IT: That word. It resembles a hirundo3.
Dr. Bellini: It is similar, yes.
SCP-032-IT: Do you have a quæstio as well, doctor?
Dr. Bellini: Indeed I do, SCP-032-IT.
SCP-032-IT: Finally! Do ask, then!
Dr. Bellini: It is about the hirundo. Can you predict its fate?
SCP-032-IT: Indeed.
Dr. Bellini: Very well, here is my quæstio: how long will it live? And how will it die?
(SCP-032-IT unfolds its appendages from the hands and probes the insides of SCP-032-IT-B. After 12 seconds the probing is over, and SCP-032-IT assumes a pensive pose for some time.)
SCP-032-IT: It will have a long life, doctor, longer than any other usual hirundo. It will die of old age. It will never get ill. There will be no foul humor in its living place. Its wounds will completely heal in twelve dies.
Dr. Bellini: Very well.
SCP-032-IT: But…
Dr. Bellini: But?
SCP-032-IT: But it will not be happy, doctor.
Dr. Bellini: Noted, SCP-032-IT. I’ll be leaving, now.
(Dr. Bellini paces towards the door)
SCP-032-IT: Doctor…
Dr. Bellini: Yes?
SCP-032-IT: I wish to know something.
Dr. Bellini: Ask away, SCP-032-IT.
SCP-032-IT: Here, under the new sky… is the Imperator here as well?
Dr. Bellini: Eh…? No, no…
SCP-032-IT: Are you sure about that?
Dr. Bellini: Yes…
SCP-032-IT: During my stay in the new Neapolis, many times I have seen his sigillum.
(The cranial appendages of SCP-032-IT protrude from the head, moving around nervously)
SCP-032-IT: I wish to know if the Imperator is under the new sky! I wish to meet him!
Dr. Bellini: No, SCP-032-IT. Imperators disappeared millennia ago. There is no Imperator here.
(The cranial appendages fold back inside the object. SCP-032-IT assumes a pensive pose for some time. Dr. Bellini leaves the room)
SCP-032-IT: I see.

Addendum #1
SCP-032-IT-B is kept in a sterile environment under close observation. After 12 days the subject is completely healed from the wounds inflicted, and is as of now perfectly healthy.

–Dr. Bellini



Addendum #2
As per requested by Dr. Bellini, any and all contact is to be avoided between SCP-032-IT and SCP-006-IT as a safety precaution.

(Dr. Bellini enters SCP-032-IT’s cell)
Dr. Bellini: Good morning, SCP-032-IT.
SCP-032-IT: Ave doctor. Do you have a quæstio? A personal one, I mean.
Dr. Bellini: You know, SCP-032-IT, come to think of it… after all, knowing the future is an attractive idea.
SCP-032-IT: I know, doctor, that is why I came to be.
Dr. Bellini: But… for now, I’m not too keen on being dug inside, do you understand?
SCP-032-IT: No. But I have observed that the men of this era are different.
Dr. Bellini: You mean because of our clothing, our technology?
SCP-032-IT: No, what I mean is that you are more easily frightened.
Dr. Bellini: Oh. Well, would you like to know how SCP-032-IT-B is doing? I mean, the hirundo?
SCP-032-IT: I know that already. I have read the templum of the hirundo.
(Dr. Bellini scribbles on a notepad)
Dr. Bellini: I will need some other foresight on it, later on, SCP-032-IT.
SCP-032-IT: Doctor, I’m afraid… that such a thing is not possible.
Dr. Bellini: And why is that, SCP-032-IT? You don’t want to?
SCP-032-IT: That is not the case. I do wish to do it, as much as I can wish anything, but all my time spent in the water… I’m afraid it didn’t ruin my outer self only.
Dr. Bellini: What do you mean?
SCP-032-IT: I have lost some sensitivity in my appendages, even though they are whole again. I… don’t reckon I can read one’s fate more than once.
Dr. Bellini: I see… hold on a second, during the experiment with D-54399 you answered two questions.
SCP-032-IT: That is correct, but one of them was about his past.
Dr. Bellini: Ah.
SCP-032-IT: As for you, doctor, I can still foresee your future. Would you like that?
Dr. Bellini: Why are you so obsessed with your predictions, SCP-032-IT?
SCP-032-IT: Because that is my goal. Also, all the time I spent at sea made me impatient, I could not wait to serve my purpose again, but I could not move…
Dr. Bellini: Go ahead, SCP-032-IT.
SCP-032-IT: My last owner, Brutus, put me on a ship, but it sunk shortly after sailing from the port of Puteoli. I believe he wanted to send me to Hiberia, although I am not sure of that. I could not break free of the relic, so I had to stay there. I remained under water for so long that I can no longer repair my outer self the way I wish to. From under the wreckage of the ship I could see the alternating of light and dark, and thus I counted the dies. Can you imagine what it is like, to be eroded by salt water, little by little, watching as your body decays, for millennia?
Dr. Bellini: I can’t, no… but it does sound like a nightmare.
SCP-032-IT: Indeed, sometimes it was almost annoying.
(Dr. Bellini remains some time with his hand on his forehead.)
Dr. Bellini: Tell me about your predictions, SCP-032-IT… has it ever happened that an event was avoided because of your very own foretelling?
SCP-032-IT: No, one cannot change the fatum.
Dr. Bellini: You mean that what you foresee will happen anyways?
SCP-032-IT: Of course, it wouldn’t be a valid foretelling otherwise, would it?
Dr. Bellini: So if you predict that a vase will fall upon me there is nothing I can ever do to avoid it, even knowing what and when it will happen?
SCP-032-IT: No, there is no way.
Dr. Bellini: Ah.
(Dr. Bellini scribbles on a notepad, then remains assorted in thought)
SCP-032-IT: What is there, doctor?
Dr. Bellini: You know, the thought of a predetermined destiny is… disturbing.
SCP-032-IT: Why is that? Those I predicted their fate to before the shipwreck had no such problem. Cæsar welcomed it with much tranquility.
Dr. Bellini: Who? That Cesar?
SCP-032-IT: If you mean that of a specific individual, then know that one’s fatum is different from anyone else’s. The Cæsar I’m talking about was a dictator of the Urbe.
(Dr. Bellini scribbles on a notepad)
Dr. Bellini: Go on, SCP-032-IT, What were you saying about Cesar?
SCP-032-IT: That he was not moved at all by my foretelling of his death. On the contrary, that very day he went for a walk in the Senate.
Dr. Bellini: You predicted Cesar’s death by the hand of Brutus?!
SCP-032-IT: Brutus?! He was the one to do it?
Dr. Bellini: Of course, don’t you know?
SCP-032-IT: I do not understand, Brutus was like a son to Cæsar…
Dr. Bellini: Didn’t you say you predicted it?
SCP-032-IT: No, I did not read this in his templum… Cæsar only wanted me to tell him where and when… but ordered me not to tell him how… or who.
(Dr. Bellini scribbles on a notepad)
Dr. Bellini: This was… interesting, SCP-032-IT. I have to go now, see you soon.
SCP-032-IT: Ave to you, doctor.
(Dr. Bellini exits the cell)

Note
Today’s visit to SCP-032-IT disturbs me.
It’s not SCP-032-IT’s fault at all; on the contrary, it is very gentle, and completely harmless if handled correctly.
But its mere existence is proof that we have no choice in doing what we do…
Proof that free will is nothing but a grand and subtle illusion…
Proof that no one is truly free.

–Dr. Bellini
