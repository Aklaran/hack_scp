SCP-016-IT SCP-016-IT within its case.


Item #: SCP-016-IT
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: When not subject to testing, SCP-016-IT must be stored in a glass case inside Storage Unit 42 of the Vulcano Site. Any further testing must be approved by Dr. Montorsi.
Description: SCP-016-IT has an identical appearance to a blank DVD used for burning, and is devoid of any type of writing that identifies the brand or model. It was found together with its transparent rigid plastic case; on the back of the case, attached with tape, is a piece of paper with the words "Write and play :)" written on it.
When SCP-016-IT is inserted into any device with a DVD player (for example a computer), the object will not be recognized by the device, which will not acknowledge the presence of the DVD. After several tests, researchers found that is anything is written on the surface of SCP-016-IT before inserting it into a device, it will be recognized and executed as a normal DVD.
Now the meaning of the note on the back of the case is clear. - Dr. Montorsi
The resulting program, hereafter referred to as SCP-016-IT-01, will change depending on the writing on SCP-016-IT, but will always be a video game with the same title as what is written on the DVD (for more information see Addendum 02). Removing SCP-016-IT from the reader causes SCP-016-IT-01 to stop and the device will return to the initial screen. Furthermore, the writing on SCP-016-IT will have disappeared.
Attempts to create a physical copy of SCP-016-IT, both with and without writing, will always result in the creation of a blank DVD, without any anomalous properties. The same applies to any and all digital copies of SCP-016-IT-01, which will be executable files that, when started, will not produce any results.
Researchers also attempted to understand how the writing on SCP-016-IT disappears, using a transparent external DVD player. At a first observation the writing seems to disappear during the initial phase of the disk rotation. Looking at the scene in slow motion, the letters can be observed to fade with each turn, assuming the background color of the DVD within a few seconds of starting the process. Attempts with indelible ink have not produced appreciable results.
Addendum 01: Notes on the recovery of SCP-016-IT.
SCP-016-IT was recovered by the SIR-I "Aureæ Notitiæ" during the exploration of the ████████ headquarters, a small independent videogame house that disappeared a few months after its creation.
The mission was undertaken as, just before the disappearance, the company advertised a revolutionary video game that would soon be launched on the market. The disappearances that followed these declarations made the infiltrated agents in the sector suspicious, who suggested to carry out an investigation.
Investigations in the offices of the company revealed that all the employees had mysteriously disappeared. The president's office a particularly sophisticated safe was discovered, of the model usually utilized in high security vaults. After several hours of work Foundation experts managed to force it, finding only SCP-016-IT inside, which was recovered for research purposes.
Following the inspection, the Foundation's technicians, using the company's communication channels, communicated the failure of the videogame house for economic reasons. Further investigations are underway.
Addendum 02: In the following tests "Title" refers to the words written on SCP-016-IT.

- Partial test log

Test 016-01 - ██ / ██ / 2016

Title: Test
Device: Computer1
Results: Game based on a series of general multiple choice questions.
Analysis: SCP-016-IT is able to start a computer program, in particular a video game, concerning the writing on the DVD.

Test 016-05 - / ██ / 2016

Title: Pong
Device: Computer
Results: Game identical to "Pong" from 1972.
Analysis: It is likely that SCP-016-IT contains some kind of database with information about existing video games.

As of now now we have not yet been able to access any files within SCP-016-IT, except for the executable that starts SCP-016-IT-01. - Dr. Montorsi
Test 016-12 - 2016 / ██ / 2016

Title: Super Mario
Device: Computer
Results: Third-person action game featuring a superhero called "Super Mario".
Analysis: SCP-016-IT-01 is not always a copy of an existing video game, rather it is thought that the title provided is interpreted in a more literal way.

Test 016-23 - 2016 / ██ / 2016

Title: Boeing 747
Device: Computer
Results: Simulator in which a Boeing 747 aircraft is piloted.
Analysis: A new test will be performed using the same title, to check if SCP-016-IT-01 will take on a different form.

Test 016-24 - 2016 / ██ / 2016

Title: Boeing 747
Device: Computer
Results: Game identical to the previous test.
Analysis: Entering the same title several times SCP-016-IT-01 does not create a different video game.

What if we tried something other than a computer? - Dr. Rivoli
Test 016-35 - / ██ / 2016

Title: War
Device: Xbox video game console
Results: First person shooter set in imaginary place and time.
Analysis: SCP-016-IT seems able to work on any device with a DVD player.

Test 016-36 - 2016 / ██ / 2016

Title: War
Device: Xbox 360 video game console
Results: Game identical to the previous test, but with much improved graphics and gameplay.
Analysis: Apparently SCP-016-IT can adapt to the device in which it is inserted, improving its performance.

Test 016-43 - 2017 / ██ / 2017

Title: Tsgevrjsocueh
Device: Computer
Results: At start-up a black screen appears with the word "Error" in white.
Analysis: First error message returned by SCP-016-IT-01.

It is probable that there is a limit to what the object can interpret. We will carry out further tests similar to the previous one in order to confirm this theory. - Dr. Montorsi
Test 016-64 - / ██ / 2017

Title: SCP-682
Device: PlayStation 3 video game console
Results: Game in which the user plays the role of a huge reptile with the aim of causing as much damage as possible.
Analysis: It seems that SCP-016-IT is aware, even if vaguely, of confidential information. It is forbidden to provide titles of confidential documents without having the necessary authorization.

Test 016-117 - 2017 / ██ / 2017

Title: SCP Foundation
Device: Computer
Results: Management game in which the player takes control of the SCP Foundation, an invented multinational company that lacks connections with the real Foundation, with the aim of earning as much as possible.
Analysis: Control test to verify the extension of information within SCP-016-IT regarding the Foundation. Satisfactory result.

Test 016-117 - ██ / ██ /2017 (Original)

Title: SCP Foundation
Device: Computer
Results: Management game set in the near future in which the player takes control of the SCP Foundation's sites around the world, with the aim of containing various anomalies.
Analysis: Most of the anomalies that appear in this version of SCP-016-IT-01 are extremely similar to the anomalies currently contained in Foundation sites. There are also several unknown anomalies, one of which, a humanoid Keter-Class SCP, represents the main antagonist in the game, for which a containment method has not yet been devised. The Foundation within SCP-016-IT-01 differs in some points from the real one: the O5 Council has been replaced by a single Superintendent, the termination of the SCP is taken into consideration for all the elements of Class other than Safe. Furthermore, as the game will suggest several times during the story, not terminating SCPs will inevitably lead to the final defeat.

The Superintendency of the Italian branch of the SCP Foundation was made aware of new developments. This version of SCP-016-IT-01 will be subject to further studies so as to determine whether the aforementioned unknown anomalies are actually existing or invented. Furthermore, I suggest that the game obtained with this test is to be used as a "testing ground" for the study of containment methods as it could provide interesting insights. For the moment, an entry containing false information will be inserted in the test log. - Dr. Montorsi
