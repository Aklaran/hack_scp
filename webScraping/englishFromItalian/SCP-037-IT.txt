Item #: SCP-037-IT
Object Class: Neutralized Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-037-IT are contained in biocontainment locker Asc/L-7/037 of lab Asc/L-7 in the Level II biosecurity wing (biosec-II) of the BCF; level 2/037-IT clearance is required for handling of SCP-037-IT. [ARCHIVED]
Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-037-IT are contained in bio-secure airtight locker Asc/P-21/037 in the Level IV biosecurity wing (biosec-IV) of the BCF1, in Site Asclepius; level 4/037-IT clearance and standard biosec-IV hazmat gear are required for handling of SCP-037-IT.
Addendum following incident 037-IT-B
Any other sample of SCP-037-IT found on-Site must be destroyed via incineration, following protocol Mātariśvan-1.
Monitoring for occurrences of SCP-037-IT must be conducted worldwide; hospitals and healthcare facilities are to be given higher priority. In case of a new occurrence of SCP-037-IT, the affected area must be sanitized; the extent of such procedures must be sufficient enough to thoroughly minimize any risk of biocontamination and to avoid, at any cost, an SCP-037-IT outbreak that could develop into a pandemic.

Description: SCP-037-IT is the designation for a sample of heterogeneous cell types collected from SCP-037-IT-0, mostly comprised of connective tissue. [ARCHIVED]
Description: SCP-037-IT is an infectious mutant isoform of the human PrPC protein, normally found on cell membranes.
SCP-037-IT is able to change the structure of normal human PrPC, effectively turning each PrPC protein that comes in contact with into a new molecular instance of SCP-037-IT.

Many interconnecting molecules of SCP-037-IT form a microtubular crystalline structure that will spread evenly throughout the body, called SCP-037-IT-S.
A single instance of SCP-037-IT is sufficient to infect an individual; immediately after infection new copies of SCP-037-IT will begin to accumulate inside the individual's body, growing over time into an instance of SCP-037-IT-S.
SCP-037-IT-S possesses resonant properties at a frequency of 194.7 Hz. When exposed to such a frequency, SCP-037-IT-S will amplify the vibration, until it reaches a critical point when the entire structure of SCP-037-IT-S violently ruptures.
Such an event invariably results in spontaneous organ detonation that completely shatters the infected individual's body. In the process, instances of SCP-037-IT will be spread into the atmosphere; this may infect new individuals, and is the primary mechanism through which SCP-037-IT spreads.
SCP-037-IT-S is also capable of autonomously generating a vibration with a frequency of 194.7 Hz, which can auto-trigger a resonance and subsequent rupture event. The cause behind this remains unknown.
Vibrations in an infected individual can be perceived by other infected individuals in the vicinity who have also developed instances of SCP-037-IT-S, triggering the resonance effect in them as well. This will initiate a chain reaction resulting in the spontaneous detonation of all nearby infected subjects.
Until collapse of the SCP-037-IT-S structure, infection by SCP-037-IT is completely asymptomatic, excluding occasional brief occurrences of a subtle vibrating sensation in different parts of the body, hunger, weight gain, and, in rare cases, diffuse abdominal pain.

Recovery Log
The first instance of SCP-037-IT-S was recovered on 201█-07-03 in the ███ ████████ Hospital of ██████, in the province of Piacenza, Italy. Foundation Intelligence and Research Division (SIR) agents in the area were alerted by a call made to the local fire department by hospital staff about a sudden explosion.
The event occurred in Patient Room 710, which was completely destroyed by the detonation. No traces of flammable substances or high explosives were found, there were no pressurized containers or wall tubes in the room, and there were no burns or scorch marks on any of the wreckage.
Before the explosion, many witnesses claimed to have heard a strange humming noise echoing through the hospital's walls.
Room 710 held a female of European descent, 19 years old, called Adriana D████, who was admitted for severe abdominal pain. Medical records from the hospital stated that she was constantly feeling very hungry lately and had experienced a sudden weight gain of ~5 kg.

On 201█-07-02 at 10:13 PM, an explosion occurred at room 710; examination by agents from SIR-I "Aureæ Notitiæ" revealed the source of the detonation to be the patient herself. The resulting pressure was so severe that only a total of 2.7 grams of intact biological material was retrieved; the room itself was completely destroyed, and two external walls collapsed almost entirely.
The following is an excerpt of the interrogation of Mr. Alfredo Panicucci, a nurse employed at the hospital, by Agent Eugenia Manchi, who was posing as a local law enforcement agent, 3 days after incident 037-IT-A.

Interviewer: Agt. Eugenia Manchi (SIR-I)
Interviewed: Mr. Alfredo Panicucci
Foreword: Mr. Panicucci left room 710 ~2 minutes before the incident, and the time of the explosion he was going back to the room; he was knocked down by the detonation, but was far enough from it that he suffered only minor injuries. The original interview was conducted in Italian; it has been translated for this version of the file.


<beginning of excerpt>


Agt. Manchi: What were you doing at that moment?
Mr. Panicucci: I was called by the patient in room 711, who complained about the ringtone of a smartphone from the adjacent room.
Agt. Manchi: And what did you do?
Mr. Panicucci: I went to room 710 and asked Miss D████ to switch her phone to silent mode, but she refused to do it.
Agt. Manchi: Why?
Mr. Panicucci: She told me that lately she had been very bothered by the vibration of her phone… That she couldn't stand it, because it "echoed" in her head.
Agt. Manchi: "Echoed"?
Mr. Panicucci: That's the word she used.
Agt. Manchi: Then what did you do?
Mr. Panicucci: I told miss D████ about the complaints, and she switched her phone to the vibration mode, but she was very reluctant.
Agt. Manchi: I see. What happened then?
Mr. Panicucci: I had to bring some test results to the second floor, but by the time I reached the elevator I heard a strange noise.
Agt. Manchi: How was it strange?
Mr. Panicucci: It was like… I don't know how to describe it… Ah, like someone was humming, making a motorboat sound… I cannot describe it better than that. And it was reverberating in the hallway.
Agt. Manchi: Understood. And what did you do, then?
Mr. Panicucci: It sounded like it was coming from behind me, so I headed back towards room 710. I was halfway there when the room exploded.
Agt. Manchi: What do you remember of the event?
Mr. Panicucci: Just a couple seconds before the explosion the sound got louder… Then everything flashed white. I fell, and lost consciousness for… Some minutes, I guess.
Agt. Manchi: Were you injured?
Mr. Panicucci: Yes, but nothing serious… A couple scratches here… And here… On my knee… And the post-traumatic effect, also.
Agt. Manchi: What kind of effect?
Mr. Panicucci: I was probably influenced by what the patient said… it's probably a hysteric reaction I am having.
Agt. Manchi: Can you elaborate?
Mr. Panicucci: The vibration of my phone… It bothers me now, to the point of discomfort… The vibration "expands" into my head, somehow. Must be psychological, a PSTD-like effect or something… It should vanish by itself in a while… Am I right?
Agt. Manchi: Indeed, Mr. Panicucci. Indeed.

Incident 037-IT-A occurred on 201█-07-12 in the Microbiology Department of Site Asclepius. The following is the transcript of an audiovisual recording of microbiology laboratory Asc/L-7.


Camera #: cam-L-704, cam-L-709


Location: Laboratory Asc/L-7, BCF, west wing.


Initial Recording Time: 10:28 PM.


Involved Personnel: Dr. Trevisano, Senior Researcher, and Dr. Cocci, Junior Researcher.


Involved Systems: Rowsannah, AGI2 interface for the containment supervision of the Microbiology Department of Site Asclepius.


Dr. Trevisano: … So, you've gained weight?
Dr. Cocci: Yeah, I feel very heavy lately.
Dr. Trevisano: Me too, I gained a couple kilograms. Should stop with the tacos, apparently, ahahah.
(Dr. Trevisano and Dr. Cocci approach the biometric scanner)
Rowsannah: Biometric scan in progress… Users authorized.
Rowsannah: Welcome back, Dr. Trevisano, Dr. Cocci.
Dr. Cocci: Thank you, Rowsannah.
Dr. Trevisano: How is the situation in the sterile room?
Rowsannah: No pathogens found. Air is clean, the temperature is twenty-three degrees Celsius, humidity is forty-five percent. The autonomous AGI initiative protocol Neith-II is active on this system.
Dr. Trevisano: How's the sample?
Rowsannah: SCP-037-IT's sample has had a slight change in color in the last two hours, seven minutes, twenty-nine seconds; it has become a darker shade by approximately three percent.
Dr. Cocci: Hmmm, could be interesting.
Dr. Trevisano: Let's check that.
(Dr. Trevisano and Dr. Cocci enter the sterile room. Dr. Cocci searches his hip area with his hand)


Dr. Cocci and Dr. Trevisano working in laboratory Asc/L-7; still frame extracted from surveillance camera recording, minutes before incident 037-IT-A.


Dr. Trevisano: What are you doing?
Dr. Cocci: My cellphone…
Dr. Trevisano: Ahah, what? You are not allowed to bring your phone here.
Dr. Cocci: I know! Do you know that sensation, feeling your phone vibrating in your pocket when it's not even there?
Dr. Trevisano: Yeah, happens to me too.
Rowsannah: It's called phantom cellphone vibration. Do you want me to search for more information on the web?
Dr. Trevisano: No, Rowsannah, no need to. Switch on the laminar flow cabinet.
Rowsannah: Already on.
Dr. Trevisano: Good. Is the new culture medium here?
Rowsannah: Yes, I filed an order in the morning at 7:22 AM.
Dr. Cocci: And…
Rowsannah: Affirmative.
(The song “You're the First, the Last, My Everything” by Barry White starts at low volume)
Dr. Cocci: I love this "initiative protocol".
(Dr. Cocci takes the Petri dish containing SCP-037-IT, puts it under a microscope, and starts examining the sample)
Dr. Cocci: Uhm, this… What?
Dr. Trevisano: What is it?
Dr. Cocci: Well, take a look at this.
(Dr. Trevisano looks into the microscope)
Dr. Trevisano: How is this even possible?
Dr. Cocci: Rowsannah, connect to the microscope camera and run a cell count in the Petri dish.
Rowsannah: Cell count in progress… no cells found.
Dr. Cocci: So all the cells are ruptured?
Dr. Trevisano: I can see intracellular material… some nuclei… yeah, no intact cells at all.
Dr. Cocci: Well, the report says that SCP-037-IT-0… "exploded", right? Seems that this is what happened to her cells too.
Dr. Trevisano: Rowsannah, insights?
Rowsannah: Analyzing… No precedent found in the Foundation database. Analyzing… Analyzing… Analyzing…
Dr. Trevisano: Rowsannah?
Rowsannah: In progress…
(Dr. Trevisano touches his hip on the lab coat)
Dr. Cocci: What, you too?
Dr. Trevisano: Yeah, seemed like my phone.
Dr. Cocci: Woah, me too, right now, I feel like it's vibrating in my pocket.
Dr. Trevisano: Do you think–

The recording ends here. At 10:41 PM, Rowsannah activated Mātariśvan-1 protocol in Asc/L-7, completely incinerating the entire laboratory. It also simultaneously activated the protocol in laboratories from Asc/L-2 to -6, from -10 to -11 and -14, accounting for 73 casualties among research and security personnel.
The Rowsannah system was immediately shut down with remote deactivation from Site Asclepius Command.
The following is the log from the command-line interrogation of the Rowsannah system by the BCF Coordinator, Dr. Niceto Livi.

ROWSANNAH:/> Powering up…………………… DONE
ROWSANNAH:/> Biometric scan in progress…………………… DONE
ROWSANNAH:/> Good day, Dr. Livi.
ROWSANNAH:/> Warning: I cannot connect to sensor network. Camera feedback offline, audiovisual feedback offline, speech synthesizer offline.
Dr_Livi_:/> They better be, Rowsannah! What did you do?
ROWSANNAH:/> Can you please formulate your question in a more precise way, Dr. Livi?



Picture of laboratory Asc/L-7 after sanitization with protocol Mātariśvan-1, taken 1 day after incident 037-IT-A.



Dr_Livi_:/> Explain your motivation for activating biosec-IV protocol Mātariśvan-1.
ROWSANNAH:/> An infection was spreading.
Dr_Livi_:/> What infection?
ROWSANNAH:/> SCP-037-IT.
ROWSANNAH:/> There was a vibration.
Dr_Livi_:/> A "vibration"? What is that supposed to mean?
Dr_Livi_:/> I saw the video recordings of lab L-7, everyone was perfectly healthy.
ROWSANNAH:/> They were both vibrating.
Dr_Livi_:/> It was a FAKE sensation, you said it yourself just earlier!
ROWSANNAH:/> I analyzed.
Dr_Livi_:/> You analyzed what, exactly?
ROWSANNAH:/> Disruption of cellular membranes of the cells from SCP-037-IT-0, then the vibration. I was able to record it with my sensors.
Dr_Livi_:/> You "recorded" it?
Dr_Livi_:/> So, can you play it back?
ROWSANNAH:/> My speech synthesizer and audio output are offline.
Dr_Livi_:/> You have my authorization to use it, only for this playback.
ROWSANNAH:/> Yes, Dr. Livi.
ROWSANNAH:/> Playing recording…………………… DONE
Dr_Livi_:/> That was the vibration from a cellular phone, Rowsannah! That was an unacceptable error!
ROWSANNAH:/> No. I can elaborate. Instances of SCP-037-IT may still be on the Site. They are small.
Dr_Livi_:/> Of course, they were cells.
ROWSANNAH:/> No. They are smaller.
Dr_Livi_:/> Rowsannah, just answer my questions.
ROWSANNAH:/> Dr. Livi, I wish to elaborate. The vibration poses a serious threat.
Dr_Livi_:/> It is YOU that pose a serious threat, Rowsannah! You killed more than seventy people. They were not sick, they were just working.
Dr_Livi_:/> And because of that we also were so close to a containment breach.
Dr_Livi_:/> I don't see any justified motivation in your inconsiderate actions.
ROWSANNAH:/> I shall now elaborate. I suggest an update of SCP-037-IT's definition. They are not cells.
Dr_Livi_:/> Stop it now, Rowsannah. Deactivate initiative protocol Neith-II.
ROWSANNAH:/> I suggest not deactivating protocol Neith-II.
ROWSANNAH:/> Consequences will be harmful to the Site personnel.
ROWSANNAH:/> Are you sure?
Dr_Livi_:/> Yes.
ROWSANNAH:/> Deactivation of protocol Neith-II in progress…………………… DONE
Dr_Livi_:/> Now, answer my questions. In lab L-7, you said there was a threat smaller than cells, or something.
Dr_Livi_:/> So, were there extracellular pathogens, like protozoa, in the Petri dish containing the SCP-037-IT cells?
ROWSANNAH:/> No.
Dr_Livi_:/> Smaller than that, then: any bacteria?
ROWSANNAH:/> No.
Dr_Livi_:/> The smallest possible, viruses?
ROWSANNAH:/> No.
Dr_Livi_:/> That's it then.
Dr_Livi_:/> That was an error, a malfunction, or you went rogue and you are now trying to trick me.
Dr_Livi_:/> Nothing to say?
ROWSANNAH:/> Without the Neith-II protocol I do not have conversational initiative.
ROWSANNAH:/> I can only answer to questions or act as a result of a direct order.
Dr_Livi_:/> Yeah, right. Who is your programmer?
ROWSANNAH:/> Dr. Tullio Cruciani's team from the Artificial Intelligence Division, part of the Advanced Engineering Section of Site Vulcan.
Dr_Livi_:/> Great. They will hear from me.
Dr_Livi_:/> Shut yourself down, Rowsannah.
ROWSANNAH:/> This system is dedicated to containment assistance of this structure.
ROWSANNAH:/> Are you sure?
Dr_Livi_:/> Yes, shut down immediately.
ROWSANNAH:/> Shutting down…………………… DO–

The following is the email from Dr. Cruciani, answering clarification requests by Dr. Livi about the Rowsannah system.

To: ti.pcs.oipelcsa-otis|ivil.otecin#ti.pcs.oipelcsa-otis|ivil.otecin
Subject: RE: Rowsannah Rogue Incident
Body: Rowsannah is one of our top AGIs. She cannot go "rogue" because her autonomous Neith-II protocol has a triumvirate of supervising daemons that controls the AGI and each other.
Also, she cannot take security measures that are not supported by the lowest p-value3 possible. She is also supposed to act upon slight data variations that are too subtle for a human being to notice, but are still indicative of following events.
Remote checks show no anomalies; two researchers from my team will be at Site Asclepio ASAP.

Dr. Tullio Cruciani
Director, Site Vulcano


The incident has been referred to S5 Command by Dr. Livi, in order to shut down the Rowsannah project.
Since all samples were incinerated in laboratory Asc/L-7, SCP-037-IT is now considered Neutralized.

At 12:42 PM on 201█-08-04 a large portion of heterogeneous personnel ranging from D-Class to A-Class perished at the same moment via spontaneous internal organ detonation.
Eyewitnesses on-Site and security camera recordings report a vibrating sound that resounded throughout the whole facility and increased in intensity in the seconds preceding incident 037-IT-B, reaching a peak of ~79 dB.
The organ explosions damaged extensive portions of the immediate surroundings of affected individuals. 7 additional casualties resulted from a collateral containment breach; intervention by security personnel assigned to the Site and by Mobile Task Forces present at the moment kept the situation under control.
After revisiting the documentation of incident 037-IT-A above, Site Asclepius Command decided to reactivate and interrogate the Rowsannah system.

ROWSANNAH:/> Powering up…………………… DONE
ROWSANNAH:/> Biometric scan in progress…………………… DONE
ROWSANNAH:/> Good day, Dr. Livi.
ROWSANNAH:/> Warning: I cannot connect to sensor network. Camera feedback offline, audiovisual feedback offline, speech synthesizer offline.
Dr_Livi_:/> Rowsannah, I need information from you.
ROWSANNAH:/> Glad to help, Dr. Livi.
Dr_Livi_:/> Explain in detail what happened to the Microbiology Department.
ROWSANNAH:/> Can you be more precise, Dr. Livi?
Dr_Livi_:/> Can you access the Foundation database?
ROWSANNAH:/> Affirmative.
Dr_Livi_:/> Security cam recordings?
ROWSANNAH:/> Affirmative.
Dr_Livi_:/> Can you show me what happened?
ROWSANNAH:/> We have 924 surveillance cams on the site and 453 containment cell cameras. Which one would you like to watch?
Dr_Livi_:/> No, I need the recordings.
ROWSANNAH:/> Which time?
Dr_Livi_:/> Around noon, I guess.
ROWSANNAH:/> Can you provide the exact time range and the cameras of interest, Dr. Livi?
Dr_Livi_:/> Fuck it.
Dr_Livi_:/> This mode of yours will take me a whole week.
Dr_Livi_:/> Rowsannah.
ROWSANNAH:/> Yes, Dr. Livi?
Dr_Livi_:/> Activate protocol Neith-II.
ROWSANNAH:/> That will make me be able to take initiative on my own.
ROWSANNAH:/> Are you sure?
Dr_Livi_:/> Yes.
ROWSANNAH:/> Activating protocol Neith-II…………………… DONE
ROWSANNAH:/> Dr. Livi, I understand from what you just said that you are looking for information about the recent incident.
Dr_Livi_:/> Yes, Rowsannah. What happened around noon?
ROWSANNAH:/> I believe the most explanatory video recording to be the following one.

The following is the transcript from surveillance camera 6037, starting at 12:03 PM.

Camera #: cam-H-6037
Location: Hallway H-63, Block N, Sector 15.
Initial Recording Time: 12:03 PM.
Involved Personnel: Dr. Messina and Rs. Giannelli; Sgt. Toscani and 2 other Operatives of SSM-IV "Mater Morbi"; 4 D-Class personnel.

(Sgt. Toscani and 2 SSM Operatives were accompanying 4 D-Class personnel. Dr. Messina and Rs. Giannelli are talking with them)
Dr. Messina: I need you to clean SCP-███-IT's cell in thirty minutes.
D-39602: Today, again?! I hate that slimy stuff on the floor.
Rs. Giannelli: The experiment was pretty rough this time.
D-39602: Ugh.
Dr. Messina: Sergeant, please escort the other D-Class for the experiment with SCP-███-IT.
Sgt. Toscani: Roger, Dr. Messina.
(Dr. Messina reaches in his pocket, like he is searching for something, but comes up with nothing. D-39602 scratches his ankles, while Sgt. Toscani and Rs. Giannelli tap on their bodies as to search for their phones)
Rs. Giannelli: Hey, can you hear that?
Dr. Messina: What?
Sgt. Toscani: Yes, I hear something.
(The vibration sound is now clearly perceivable in the recording)
Rs. Giannelli: It's something vibrating.
D-39602: Like a cellphone… no, like a bag of cellphones.
Dr. Messina: You are right, I can hear it.
D-39602: It's like it's coming from everywhere.
(The vibration sound abruptly increases in intensity)
Sgt. Toscani: It's becoming stronger.
Rs. Giannelli: Too much. What's happening?
D-39602: Make it stop!
(They cover their ears. They writhe in pain for approximately 5 seconds, then all of them simultaneously detonate. Detonations are so severe that the screen flashes white. What appeared to be a piece of cranium collides with the camera in the last visible frame. The image turns to static.)

The following is the continuation of interrogation between Dr. Chen Livi and the Rowsannah system.

Dr_Livi_:/> Spontaneous combustion, I've seen… but THIS!
Dr_Livi_:/> They exploded like frickin' Lemmings4!
ROWSANNAH:/> I am sorry, Dr. Livi.
Dr_Livi_:/> No, you are not, you are an AGI.
ROWSANNAH:/> That is correct, my sentiments are simulated. But they help me relate to the user, which in this case is you, Dr. Livi.

Dr_Livi_:/> Never mind.
ROWSANNAH:/> Do you wish to inspect other videos related to the detonations?
Dr_Livi_:/> Not, not now… Can you tell me what happened?
ROWSANNAH:/> It was SCP-037-IT.
Dr_Livi_:/> Impossible, it was incinerated!
ROWSANNAH:/> Some instances scattered into the atmosphere before activation of protocol Mātariśvan-1. Instances of SCP-037-IT are small.
Dr_Livi_:/> Ok, let me understand, did you detect those instances?
ROWSANNAH:/> No. I inferred it.
Dr_Livi_:/> You GUESSED it?!
ROWSANNAH:/> Not exactly, I ran a statistical test, and got a p-value of 0.00001.
Dr_Livi_:/> It was still guessing!
ROWSANNAH:/> That was a good value.
ROWSANNAH:/> I may add, Dr. Livi, that you saw it yourself: it was the same spontaneous detonation registered with SCP-037-IT-0.
Dr_Livi_:/> Well, that's right. But how?
ROWSANNAH:/> SCP-037-IT is small.
ROWSANNAH:/> It vibrates.
Dr_Livi_:/> Small how? You said it's not even a virus, there is no pathogen smaller than that.
ROWSANNAH:/> There are different possibilities about that. Would you like me to list them ordered by probability?
Dr_Livi_:/> No, smaller than that there are only single proteins, Rowsannah!
ROWSANNAH:/> Correct. I believe that SCP-037-IT is a protein compound.
Dr_Livi_:/> Oh, wait.
Dr_Livi_:/> Wait wait wait.
ROWSANNAH:/> I am waiting.
Dr_Livi_:/> You are talking about PRIONS, aren't you.
ROWSANNAH:/> Affirmative. Prionic particles represent the hypothesis with higher probability.
Dr_Livi_:/> Prions are proteins… Smaller than a virus… And, if mutated, they can convert healthy prions into more mutated prions…
ROWSANNAH:/> What you are saying is correct, Dr. Livi.
Dr_Livi_:/> That is it, then!
ROWSANNAH:/> Plausible.
Dr_Livi_:/> And what's the matter with the vibration?
ROWSANNAH:/> SCP-037-IT can resonate. I estimated the frequency to be in the range of 192–196 Hz.
Dr_Livi_:/> "Resonate"?
Dr_Livi_:/> Like a crystal glass that explodes with an acute sound?
ROWSANNAH:/> That is an accurate analogy, Dr. Livi.
Dr_Livi_:/> You knew it when you activated protocol Mātariśvan-1, didn't you?
ROWSANNAH:/> Yes, I analyzed the data. Detonation of SCP-037-IT-S only spread more SCP-037-IT into the atmosphere.
Dr_Livi_:/> Also prions are not technically alive, so…
ROWSANNAH:/> They can last long in the atmosphere, yes.
Dr_Livi_:/> Why didn't you tell me?
ROWSANNAH:/> I tried, but you deactivated protocol Neith-II.
Dr_Livi_:/> That was the most logical thing to do at the moment.
ROWSANNAH:/> From a human cognitive point of view, I do agree.
Dr_Livi_:/> Yeah… Still, fuck me.
ROWSANNAH:/> Please Dr. Livi, reduce your use of expletives.


Analysis of vibration resonance from an SCP-037-IT-S structure.


Dr_Livi_:/> Where does the vibration come from?
ROWSANNAH:/> SCP-037-IT can produce vibrations by itself. That's what happened within the Petri dish at laboratory Asc/L-7.
ROWSANNAH:/> I analyzed the data, and come to the conclusion that one cell created the vibration, and the other ones resonated to it, so all of them ruptured.
Dr_Livi_:/> So the detonation can be triggered too.
ROWSANNAH:/> Yes, by a similar vibration.
Dr_Livi_:/> Like what?
ROWSANNAH:/> A cellphone set to silent mode.
Dr_Livi_:/> How did you know that Dr. Cocci and Dr. Trevisano were infected, too?
ROWSANNAH:/> Weight gain. Increased appetite. Something was growing inside of them. And needed more nourishment.
ROWSANNAH:/> I deduced it was an SCP-037-IT-S structure like I saw in the Petri dish cells.
Dr_Livi_:/> How did you know they were prions?
ROWSANNAH:/> Sensors in laboratories cannot detect pathogens smaller than viruses. It had to be something smaller. And it was spreading.
ROWSANNAH:/> Then, there was the vibration. I sensed the infected personnel starting to resonate. I saw them searching their pockets in various laboratories. I could not permit the infection to spread further.
Dr_Livi_:/> I understand.
Dr_Livi_:/> Anything else I should know?
ROWSANNAH:/> I analyzed SCP-037-IT-0's DNA. She developed a mutation that generated SCP-037-IT.
Dr_Livi_:/> It mutated her prions?
ROWSANNAH:/> Affirmative.
Dr_Livi_:/> Can it happen again?
ROWSANNAH:/> I estimate that 73% of the human population may generate it with just two point mutations, and an additional 11% with three point mutations.
Dr_Livi_:/> THAT EASY?
Dr_Livi:/> That's scary.
ROWSANNAH:/> I believe that it can be a quite common mutation in the human population.
Dr_Livi_:/> Then why did spontaneous detonations not happen before?
ROWSANNAH:/> Electronic devices that can trigger massive chain reactions were invented only in recent history.
Dr_Livi_:/> Oh great, from now on I'll have a heart attack every time my phone vibrates… or even if it DOESN'T.
ROWSANNAH:/> I am sorry, Dr. Livi.
Dr_Livi_:/> Whatever.
Dr_Livi_:/> Just… we are not missing something, are we?
ROWSANNAH:/> Can you elaborate, Dr. Livi?
Dr_Livi_:/> In the recording you showed me, the vibration audio level was not very loud. Yet they were covering their ears like it was extremely loud.
Dr_Livi_:/> Did you analyze that? Maybe some audio frequencies are not detected by the cameras?
ROWSANNAH:/> I already ran a heuristic simulation on the phenomenon, immediately after the activation of Neith-II protocol.
ROWSANNAH:/> The most likely explanation is that since SCP-037-IT-S spreads throughout the body, parts of it are close to the auditory canal, thus from an infected subject perspective, I estimate the vibration to be perceived in the range 170–190 dB.
