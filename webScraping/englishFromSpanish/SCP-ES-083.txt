Item #: SCP-ES-083
Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: All existing networks must be monitored for copies of SCP-ES-083. Every webpage offering a direct download of SCP-ES-083 is to be shut down, and the administrator of the page, localized and interrogated. Every person found in possession of a copy of SCP-ES-083 is to be interrogated, after which they will be treated with Class-A amnestics, while the program is eliminated from the system and replaced with a non-functional copy of similar interface.
The Foundation will maintain at least one copy of SCP-ES-083, and experiments conducted on it require authorization from a Level 2 personnel.
Description: SCP-ES-083 is a piece of software designed for the purpose of cryptographic decryption. It is composed of a single file named "decrypt.exe", with a size of 125,91 KB. Decompiling said file in order to see the source code will show a chain of text which reads [sic] "Fucking awesome. So you want to see how my program works. Well, too bad. Go study and learn like I did, and someday you will be able to make these kind of things! With love, Maximus." followed by an obscene image composed of ASCII characters. If certain actions are performed with SCP-ES-083, the warning messages will be written in the same arrogant and informal tone.
Information about a software developer under this pseudonym, working on this kind of applications, has not been found. Suspects with similar pseudonyms have been interrogated about the authorship of SCP-ES-083, however, none of them remember ever seeing the program in question.
When SCP-ES-083 is executed, a window titled "deCipher'em All v1.6" is opened, with a significant text field and a button reading "Decrypt". When this button is pressed, SCP-ES-083 analyzes the text and distinguishes between coherent phrases and unintelligible chains. In the latter, if said chain is an encrypted message, it will always in the majority of cases replace the text with its translation. If by the contrary the text is a nonsensical chain or the program does not manage to translate the encryption, it will be replaced with "Don't take me for a fool, imbecile".
SCP-ES-083 has been able to decipher all kinds of encrypted code, from pig latin to binary. In all instances, both determining if the text is an encryption and translating it will take between ██ thousands of a second and a whole second. This is the case in every instance independently of the complexity of the code. SCP-ES-083 is also capable of separating all words contained in a phrase and showing them separately, a function which is combined with the decipher. For example: writing the message "tsetasisiht" and pressing the button will give as a result "this is a test". The language in which the text is written will not affect the result.
Experiment Log:
SCP-ES-083 was tested with various kinds of encrypted messages, both hard and easy. In all cases, no matter the complexity or the expected effort, the translation was made almost immediately.

I wonder how long it will take you to figure out this phrase encrypted with a random configuration.

Triple encryption. This should take you more than a second, damned program.
