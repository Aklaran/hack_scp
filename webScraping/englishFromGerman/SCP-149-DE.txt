SCP-149-DE-A in its first encounter with Mobile Task Force DE4-𝔎.


Item #: SCP-149-DE
Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-149-DE may not be opened or entered without the authorization of at least two O4 members. Should entry be necessary, a small storage marquee is to be erected on the ground above SCP-149-DE where the opening will be made under the guise of pedologic studies. This measure serves the avoidance of eye witnesses. Complete public exclusion is impossible due to SCP-149-DE’s location.
The personnel in question has to enter SCP-149-DE unarmed and without ballistic protection equipment and is required to hold radio contact at all times. When persons are located in SCP-149-DE, at least 10 fully armed guards are to be positioned at the exit. Should radio contact be lost or when it becomes otherwise evident that the personnel in SCP-149-DE got compromised by SCP-149-DE-A, all guards have to keeps their weapons ready and to overpower or in emergency situations terminate all individuals emerging from the structure. All personnel that entered SCP-149-DE is to be subjected to a thorough psychological evaluation afterwards. Should a corruption by SCP-149-DE be detected, the affected individuals are to be classified as class E personnel and to be quarantined until further notice. The opening in SCP-149-DE is to be fully closed and concealed following the completion of all tasks.
At the moment, SCP-149-DE-A is safely contained inside SCP-149-DE and does not require further efforts. If an expedition into SCP-149-DE become necessary, SCP-149-DE-A is not to be touched under any circumstance. Until now it is not known how to evade SCP-149-DE-A’s attention once SCP-149-DE has been entered, therefore it is advised to move as fast as possible. Should SCP-149-DE-A be sighted, the expedition force must to return to the missions starting point, regardless of SCP-149-DE-A going into pursuit or not. Remote surveillance via drones, cameras and microphones is not advised.
A disinformation campaigns has to maintain the believe that SCP-149-DE got filled completely and can no longer be entered. Near SCP-149-DE, several apartments got rented from which perimeter surveillance is carried out. Should unauthorized parties try to gain access to SCP-149-DE, they are to be detained and interrogated. In case of an attack the surrounding Foundation sites are to be informed and available troops to be send by them.
Public or private efforts to build upon SCP-149-DE or to destroy it are to be prevented by all means.
Description: SCP-149-DE designates the remains of the Führerbunker in Berlin. Against openly available facts SCP-149-DE is still accessible and in better shape, even though all its entrances have been sealed.
SCP-149-DE possess three anomalous properties, of which all appear to be purely passive. First, the concrete SCP-149-DE got build from is notably harder and more solid than any other known kind of concrete. This concrete has shown no signs of aging or erosion since Foundation acquisition, presumably because of its second property to repair any damage done to it within seconds. The third property of SCP-149-DE is its apparent ability to prevent SCP-149-DE-A from leaving the structure.
SCP-149-DE-A is a class II1incorporeal humanoid entity which is seemingly trapped in SCP-149-DE. It possesses a horned head similar to a cow skull, a short tail and a transparent black muscular body. It seems as if a substance with the seeming consistency of tar keeps continuously dripping from the entity.This substance vanished once it touches a surface, because of which sampling is considered unfeasible. The size of SCP-149-DE was never accurately determined but is estimated to be 190 cm. Due to the topography of SCP-149-DE and the aggressive demeanor of SCP-149-DE-A only little data regarding its behavior is available.
During previous expeditions in SCP-149-DE, SCP-149-DE-A was observed to either walk through the corridors of the bunker or how it sat on a chair, although this behaviour was only noted during the first expedition. On all other missions SCP-149-DE was encountered seemingly searching for the expedition troops, supporting the theory that SCP-149-DE at every time knows about all affairs inside SCP-149-DE. Attempts to surveil SCP-149-DE-A with drones and cameras failed because it immediately seeks out such devices when no humans are present in SCP-149-DE. How the entity affects electronics is unknown but it is a fact that cameras touched by it only show heavily distorted footage with occasional insertions of national socialist symbols. After becoming affected by SCP-149-DE, microphones only record continuous screaming, stemming from several persons. Software used for voice analysis found a match for individual voices with those of Joseph Goebbels, Hans Krebs and Adolf Hitler. What relation those persons have to SCP-149-DE-A is unknown at this time.
SCP-149-DE behave in a hostile manner towards living humans and attacks every person that enters its field of vision. It is of note that SCP-149-DE-A passes through all materials without resistance except the walls, ceilings, floors and doors of SCP-149-DE and is therefore unable to cause physical damage. But should it touch a subject, it will stiffen while its personality is radically restructured. Those afflicted gain a worldview strongly impacted by racism, anti-semitism, anticommunism and social Darwinism as well as a great hatred against the victorious powers of the Second World War and become extremely willing to resort to violence. Subjects are from this point on driven to create and propagate a national socialist fundamental order on a global scale. To this end, they use every available means. Since intelligence and memories of the afflicted remain unchanged, sometimes a thorough psychological evaluation is required because subjects often pretend to have not been affected by SCP-149-DE-A’s properties.

Interview wit a SCP-149-DE-A subject

Foreword: Agent Reiter had been a member of MTF DE4-𝔎 „PSI-Corps”2 and had been attacked by SCP-149-DE-A on the first expedition into SCP-149-DE. Her squad members escaped unscathed according to the results of the psychological evaluation.
Agent Reiter is brought into the interrogation room by two guards and places herself on the provided chair. The guards then chain her to the table. Dr. Stier enters as well and sits down opposed to Agent Reiter.
Begin Log.
Dr. Stier: Good morning, how are you?
Agent Reiter: I waste away in a white cell here and have to endure the fuss of you doctors every day. How do you think I feel? I am healthy. Never felt better!
Dr. Stier: That is debatable… You are aware that you had a radical personality shift, are you?
Agent Reiter: You call it personality shift, I call it enlightenment.
Dr. Stier: Enlightenment? Interesting, about what were you enlightened?
Agent Reiter: This world is squalid, Doctor. To many screwed up genes in this world, they are the root of all evils that ail humanity.
Dr. Stier: What do you think to do against it? Can something be done against it?
Agent Reiter: Yes, of course you can do something against it. Sort out those with inferior genes and eradicate them with root and branch.
Dr. Stier: How would you determine who the ones possessing good genes are?
Agent Reiter: As a first step I would use the genealogy. Much bad blood can be traced back to certain races. Afterwards modern methods can be used to create humans with superior genetics.
Dr. Stier Races? Which one would be the one that you would choose?
Agent Reiter: That would be the Aryans. The are vastly superior to other races.
Dr. Stier: And all other races should be eradicated?
Agent Reiter: Yeah.
Dr. Stier: Agent Reiter, you are aware that your husband is from Hungary, right? He is a Slav. You married him two years ago.
Agent Reiter: Yes, greatest failure of my life but I didn’t know any better back then. Thank god we didn’t get children. Will get to the divorce immediately once I am out of here.
Dr. Stier: You spoke about the world being intervened by bad genes. Do you wish to enforce your agenda everywhere?
Agent Reiter: Of course, otherwise, this bane would return over and over again.
Dr. Stier: You know that the world would not be willing to let that happen.
Agent Reiter: Then we have to convince it. And who we cannot convince, we have to force.
Dr. Stier: Would you go so far as to start a war. Like, a really big one.
Agent Reiter: Yes, as big as he has to be.
Dr. Stier: You are aware that this is the ideology of the Nazis.
Agent Reiter: Yes. I can see that you aren’t thrilled but is it my fault that those assholes called Allies vilified the Nazis? They had the right idea!
Dr. Stier: I know what you are getting at and I oppose it with all my being. But tell me one thing. Why did you tell me all this so freely. Had you kept silent you could have waited until more people got attacked SCP-149-DE-A to gain more allies.
Agent Reiter: …
Dr. Stier: Mrs Reiter?
Agent Reiter: I think you are right but… It just wants out, you know? If I can’t convince you then I want you at least to listen to me. I don’t know why
Dr. Stier: Hm. I think we are done here for now.
Ende des Logs.
Closing Remarks: Agent Reiter was classified as Class E personnel and got put under surveillance. She still tries to propagate her ideology to everyone who listens to her. Others affected by SCP-149-DE showed less openness and are often secretive. Although unknown, it is regarded as probable that constitutes the result of a learning process of SCP-149-DE-A. Resulting assumptions about SCP-149-DE-A possessing a telepathic to its victims are regarded as unconfirmed —at this time (See Incident 149-DE-1). At the moment, research to sever this link is underway but so far without success.




Discovery: The Foundation became aware of SCP-149-DE when it found a few documents of the the SKP in a hidden safe during a swoop of an abandoned facility of Section XXV.

SKP-Station ███████, Berlin, the ██/██/1940

Research Report 89/2
In the course of researching new construction materials we managed a great break-through. We succeeded in creating a concrete mixture that repels all damaging substances tested so far and pulls particles beneficial for for strength and stability from the air and like this, strengthens itself further and further. In this way a extremely durable and resilient concrete is created over time that is already on par with common concretes upon pouring. This special wears the name Adamas Concrete.



SKP Headquarter, Kassel, the 01/19/1943

Approval Adamas/1
The Führer ordered the construction of a new air-raid shelter yesterday that has to ensure the safety of himself as well as the leadership. Because the Adamas Concrete passed all test runs until now, Himmler proposed it as the base material of the bunker. I hereby approve the use of the Adamas Concrete for the construction of the Führerbunker.

Obersturmbannführer Schön



Further documentation regarding the composition and production of the "Adamas Concrete" were recovered. The Foundation already created the first prototypes. Test results are still being compiled.



Initially a expedition into SCP-149-DE was put on hold because it was unknown in what form Section XXV had used the building and an unnecessary loss of personnel should be prevented until further information was available. On ██.██.2013 Research Team 25 managed the restoration of the regarding documents, followed by the planning and execution of the first expedition, followed by a psychological evaluation.
