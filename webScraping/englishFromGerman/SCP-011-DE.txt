SCP-011-DE [Nah, that's not me, I just changed the picture because I like this one better.]


Item #: SCP-011-DE



Object Class: Euclid [That's not true!]



Special Containment Procedures: [Deleted 'em]



Description: [I deleted it.]


Addendum of Dr. Lauter: I'm giving up! This was the 87th time to document this SCP. SCP-011-DE shall do whatever it wants now, it can't escape from here anyway. [My personal victory over Dr. Lauter and his annoying entries. Oh, and doctor, this is the only entry I leave you.]





>No

Too bad

Alright then. Just watch out that you won't get caught, considering that I've reported unauthorized access on this file to the O5 Council. Bye! ;-*
